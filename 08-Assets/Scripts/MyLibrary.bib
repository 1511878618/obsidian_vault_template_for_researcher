  abstract = {We report the development of multiplexed cellular super-resolution imaging using DNA-barcoded binders.           ,                             Recent advances in super-resolution fluorescence imaging allow researchers to overcome the classical diffraction limit of light, and are already starting to make an impact in biology. However, a key challenge for traditional super-resolution methods is their limited multiplexing capability, which prevents a systematic understanding of multi-protein interactions on the nanoscale. Exchange-PAINT, a recently developed DNA-based multiplexing approach, in theory facilitates spectrally-unlimited multiplexing by sequentially imaging target molecules using orthogonal dye-labeled ‘imager’ strands. While this approach holds great promise for the bioimaging community, its widespread application has been hampered by the availability of DNA-conjugated ligands for protein labeling. Herein, we report a universal approach for the creation of DNA-barcoded labeling probes for highly multiplexed Exchange-PAINT imaging, using a variety of affinity reagents such as primary and secondary antibodies, nanobodies, and small molecule binders. Furthermore, we extend the availability of orthogonal imager strands for Exchange-PAINT to over 50 and assay their orthogonality in a novel DNA origami-based crosstalk assay. Using our optimized conjugation and labeling strategies, we demonstrate nine-color super-resolution imaging               in situ               in fixed cells.},

Therefore, developing various analytical tools to map the changes in position and distribution of histone modifications is helpful in studying underlying mechanisms. Herein, we propose a high-spatial and colourimetric imaging method using plasmonic nanoparticles as probes to visualize heterochromatin histone markers in a single nucleus. We visualized the reorganization between repressive histone markers, H3K9me3 and H3K27me3, caused by oncogene-induced senescence based on the scattering colours and spectral shift of plasmonic nanoprobes to longer wavelengths using their distance-dependent coupling effect. The measured scattering profiles were correlated with the computation results simulating the scattering spectra according to the arrangements and distances among the plasmonic nanoprobes. The plasmonic nanoprobe-based high-spatial hyperspectral imaging provides an advanced way to study the dynamics of histone modifications for predicting the progression of diseases or senescence.},

  abstract = {Nanoparticle deposition in microchannel devices inducing contaminant clogging is a serious barrier to the application of micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS). For micro-scale gas flow fields with a high Knudsen number (Kn) in the microchannel, gas rarefaction and velocity slip cannot be ignored. Furthermore, the mechanism of nanoparticle transport and deposition in the microchannel is extremely complex. In this study, the compressible gas model and a second-order slip boundary condition have been applied to the Burnett equations to solve the flow field issue in a microchannel. Drag, Brownian, and thermophoretic forces are concerned in the motion equations of particles. A series of numerical simulations for various particle sizes, flow rates, and temperature gradients have been performed. Some important features such as reasons, efficiencies, and locations of particle deposition have been explored. The results indicate that the particle deposition efficiency varies more or less under the actions of forces such as Brownian force, thermophoretic force, and drag force. Nevertheless, different forces lead to different particle motions and deposition processes. Brownian or thermophoretic force causes particles to move closer to the wall or further away from it. The drag force influence of slip boundary conditions and gas rarefaction changes the particles’ residential time in the channel. In order to find a way to decrease particle deposition on the microchannel surface, the deposition locations of different sizes of particles have been analyzed in detail under the action of thermophoretic force.},

While this strategy has proven advantageous for a variety of applications, including sensing and drug discovery, it has been so far limited to the use of nucleic acids as templating elements. Here, we report the rational design of DNA templated synthesis controlled by specific IgG antibodies. Our approach is based on the co-localization of reactants induced by the bivalent binding of a specific IgG antibody to two antigen-conjugated DNA templating strands that triggers a chemical reaction that would be otherwise too slow under diluted conditions. This strategy is versatile, orthogonal and adaptable to different IgG antibodies and can be employed to achieve the targeted synthesis of clinically-relevant molecules in the presence of specific IgG biomarker antibodies.},

  abstract = {Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) causes diseases ranging from skin infections to lethal sepsis and has become a serious threat to human health due to multiple-drug resistance (MDR). Therefore, a resistance-free antibacterial therapy is necessary to overcome MDR MRSA infections. In this study, an antibacterial nanorobot (Ab-nanobot) is developed wherein a cell wall-binding domain (CBD)-endolysin, acting as a sensor, is covalently conjugated with an actuator consisting of an iron oxide/silica core-shell. The CBD-endolysin sensor shows an excellent specificity to detect, bind, and accumulate on the S. aureus USA300 cell surface even in a bacterial consortium, and in host cell infections. Ab-nanobot specifically captures and kills MRSA in response to medically approved radiofrequency (RF) electromagnetic stimulation (EMS) signal. When Ab-nanobot receives the RF-EMS signal on the cell surface, actuator induces cell death in MRSA with 99.999\% removal within 20 min by cell-wall damage via generation of localized heat and reactive oxygen species. The in vivo efficacy of Ab-nanobot is proven using a mice subcutaneous skin infection model. Collectively, this study offers a nanomedical resistance-free strategy to overcome MDR MRSA infections by providing a highly specific nanorobot for S. aureus.},

A collection of fluorogenic chromophores with various electronic properties enables to generate bimolecular fluorescent assemblies that cover the visible spectrum from blue to red using a single protein tag engineered and optimized by directed evolution and rational design. The ability to tune the fluorescence color and properties through simple molecular modulation provides a broad experimental versatility for imaging proteins in live cells, including neurons, and in multicellular organisms, and opens avenues for optimizing Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) biosensors in live cells. The ability to tune the spectral properties and fluorescence performance enables furthermore to match the specifications and requirements of advanced super-resolution imaging techniques.},

Nucleic acid-based molecular tension probes allow one to visualize the piconewton (pN) forces applied by these receptors. Building on this technology, we recently developed molecular force microscopy (MFM) which uses fluorescence polarization to map receptor force orientation with diffraction-limited resolution (\textasciitilde 250\,nm). Here, we show that structured illumination microscopy (SIM), a super-resolution technique, can be used to perform super-resolution MFM. Using SIM-MFM, we generate the highest resolution maps of both the magnitude and orientation of the pN traction forces applied by cells. We apply SIM-MFM to map platelet and fibroblast integrin forces, as well as T cell receptor forces. Using SIM-MFM, we show that~platelet traction force alignment occurs on a longer timescale than adhesion. Importantly, SIM-MFM can be implemented on any standard SIM microscope without hardware modifications.},

  abstract = {The limited photon budget of fluorescent dyes is the main limitation for localization precision in localization-based super-resolution microscopy. Points accumulation for imaging in nanoscale topography (PAINT)-based techniques use the reversible binding of fluorophores and can sample a single binding site multiple times, thus elegantly circumventing the photon budget limitation. With DNA-based PAINT (DNA-PAINT), resolutions down to a few nanometers have been reached on DNA-origami nanostructures. However, for long acquisition times, we find a photo-induced depletion of binding sites in DNA-PAINT microscopy that ultimately limits the quality of the rendered images. Here we systematically investigate the loss of binding sites in DNA-PAINT imaging and support the observations with measurements of DNA hybridization kinetics via surface-integrated fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (SI-FCS). We do not only show that the depletion of binding sites is clearly photo-induced, but also provide evidence that it is mainly caused by dye-induced generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). We evaluate two possible strategies to reduce the depletion of binding sites: By addition of oxygen scavenging reagents, and by the positioning of the fluorescent dye at a larger distance from the binding site.},

Here we show that computationally designed, two-component nanoparticle immunogens(2) induce potently neutralizing and broadly protective antibody responses against a wide variety of influenza viruses. The nanoparticle immunogens contain 20 haemagglutinin glycoprotein trimers in an ordered array, and their assembly in vitro enables the precisely controlled co-display of multiple distinct haemagglutinin proteins in defined ratios. Nanoparticle immunogens that co-display the four haemagglutinins of licensed quadrivalent influenza vaccines elicited antibody responses in several animal models against vaccine-matched strains that were equivalent to or better than commercial quadrivalent influenza vaccines, and simultaneously induced broadly protective antibody responses to heterologous viruses by targeting the subdominant yet conserved haemagglutinin stem. The combination of potent receptor-blocking and cross-reactive stem-directed antibodies induced by the nanoparticle immunogens makes them attractive candidates for a supraseasonal influenza vaccine candidate with the potential to replace conventional seasonal vaccines(3).},

When within promoter regions, the i-motif has the potential to act as a molecular switch for controlling gene expression. However, i-motif structures in genomic areas of repetitive nucleotide sequences may play a role in facilitating or hindering expansion of these DNA elements. Despite research on the i-motif trailing behind the complementary G-quadruplex structure, recent discoveries including the identification of a specific i-motif antibody are pushing this field forward. This perspective reviews initial and current work characterizing the i-motif and providing insight into the biological function of this DNA structure, with a focus on how the i-motif can serve as a molecular target for developing new therapeutic approaches to modulate gene expression and extension of repetitive DNA.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) has allowed the observation of various molecular structures in cells beyond the diffraction limit using organic dyes. In principle, the SMLM resolution depends on the precision of photoswitching fluorophore localization, which is inversely correlated with the square root of the number of photons released from the individual fluorophores. Thus, increasing the photon number by using highly bright fluorophores, such as quantum dots (QDs), can theoretically fundamentally overcome the current resolution limit of SMLM. However, the use of QDs in SMLM has been challenging because QDs have no photoswitching property, which is essential for SMLM, and they exhibit nonspecificity and multivalency, which complicate their use in fluorescence imaging. Here, we present a method to utilize QDs in SMLM to surpass the resolution limit of the current SMLM utilizing organic dyes. We confer monovalency, specificity, and photoswitchability on QDs by steric exclusion via passivation and ligand exchange with ptDNA, PEG, and casein as well as by DNA point accumulation for imaging in nanoscale topography (DNA-PAINT) via automatic thermally driven hybridization between target-bound docking and dye-bound complementary imager strands. QDs are made monovalent and photoswitchable to enable SMLM and show substantially better photophysical properties than Cy3, with higher fluorescence intensity and an improved resolution factor. QD-PAINT displays improved spatial resolution with a narrower full width at half maximum (FWHM) than DNA-PAINT with Cy3. In summary, QD-PAINT shows great promise as a next-generation SMLM method for overcoming the limited resolution of the current SMLM.},

  abstract = {As a cellular interface between the blood and tissues, the endothelial cell (EC) monolayer is involved in the control of key functions including vascular tone, permeability and homeostasis, leucocyte trafficking and hemostasis. EC regulatory functions require long-distance communications between ECs, circulating hematopoietic cells and other vascular cells for efficient adjusting thrombosis, angiogenesis, inflammation, infection and immunity. This intercellular crosstalk operates through the extracellular space and is orchestrated in part by the secretory pathway and the exocytosis of Weibel Palade Bodies (WPBs), secretory granules and extracellular vesicles (EVs). WPBs and secretory granules allow both immediate release and regulated exocytosis of messengers such as cytokines, chemokines, extracellular membrane proteins, coagulation or growth factors. The ectodomain shedding of transmembrane protein further provide the release of both receptor and ligands with key regulatory activities on target cells. Thin tubular membranous channels termed tunneling nanotubes (TNTs) may also connect EC with distant cells. EVs, in particular exosomes, and TNTs may contain and transfer different biomolecules (e.g., signaling mediators, proteins, lipids, and microRNAs) or pathogens and have emerged as a major triggers of horizontal intercellular transfer of information.},

  abstract = {Cellular communication is an essential process for the development and maintenance of all tissues including the eye. Recently, a new method of cellular communication has been described, which relies on formation of tubules, called tunneling nanotubes (TNTs). These structures connect the cytoplasm of adjacent cells and allow the direct transport of cellular cargo between cells without the need for secretion into the extracellular milieu. TNTs may be an important mechanism for signaling between cells that reside long distances from each other or for cells in aqueous environments, where diffusion-based signaling is challenging. Given the wide range of cargoes transported, such as lysosomes, endosomes, mitochondria, viruses, and miRNAs, TNTs may play a role in normal homeostatic processes in the eye as well as function in ocular disease. This review will describe TNT cellular communication in ocular cell cultures and the mammalian eye               in vivo               , the role of TNTs in mitochondrial transport with an emphasis on mitochondrial eye diseases, and molecules involved in TNT biogenesis and their function in eyes, and finally, we will describe TNT formation in inflammation, cancer, and stem cells, focusing on pathological processes of particular interest to vision scientists.},

  abstract = {A tumor-homing peptide, F3, selectively binds to endothelial cells in tumor blood vessels and to tumor cells. Here, we show that the cell surface molecule recognized by F3 is nucleolin. Nucleolin specifically bound to an F3 peptide affinity matrix from extracts of cultured breast carcinoma cells. Antibodies and cell surface biotin labeling revealed nucleolin at the surface of actively growing cells, and these cells bound and internalized fluorescein-conjugated F3 peptide, transporting it into the nucleus. In contrast, nucleolin was exclusively nuclear in serum-starved cells, and F3 did not bind to these cells. The binding and subsequent internalization of F3 were blocked by an antinucleolin antibody. Like the F3 peptide, intravenously injected antinucleolin antibodies selectively accumulated in tumor vessels and in angiogenic vessels of implanted “matrigel” plugs. These results show that cell surface nucleolin is a specific marker of angiogenic endothelial cells within the vasculature. It may be a useful target molecule for diagnostic tests and drug delivery applications.},

  abstract = {Abstract             DNA can form many structures beyond the canonical Watson–Crick double helix. It is now clear that noncanonical structures are present in genomic DNA and have biological functions. G-rich G-quadruplexes and C-rich i-motifs are the most well-characterized noncanonical DNA motifs that have been detected in vivo with either proscribed or postulated biological roles. Because of their independent sequence requirements, these structures have largely been considered distinct types of quadruplexes. Here, we describe the crystal structure of the DNA oligonucleotide, d(CCAGGCTGCAA), that self-associates to form a quadruplex structure containing two central antiparallel G-tetrads and six i-motif C–C+ base pairs. Solution studies suggest a robust structural motif capable of assembling as a tetramer of individual strands or as a dimer when composed of tandem repeats. This hybrid structure highlights the growing structural diversity of DNA and suggests that biological systems may harbor many functionally important non-duplex structures.},

It suffers, however, from high background and very slow imaging speed, both of which can be attributed to the presence of unbound fluorophores in solution. We present a fluorogenic DNA-PAINT probe that solves these problems and demonstrate 3D imaging without the need for optical sectioning and a 26-fold increase in imaging speed over regular DNA-PAINT.},

To address this issue, we propose the additions of ethylene carbonate (EC) to the imaging buffer, sequence repeats to the docking strand, and a spacer between the docking strand and the affinity agent. Collectively termed DNA-PAINT-ERS (E\,=\,EC, R\,=\,Repeating sequence, and S\,=\,Spacer), these strategies can be easily integrated into current DNA-PAINT workflows for both accelerated imaging speed and improved image quality through optimized DNA hybridization kinetics and efficiency. We demonstrate the general applicability of DNA-PAINT-ERS for fast, multiplexed superresolution imaging using previously validated oligonucleotide constructs with slight modifications.},

Its performance in biological samples is often constrained by strong background signals and non-specific binding events, both exacerbated by high imager concentrations. Here we describe Repeat DNA-PAINT, a method that enables a substantial reduction in imager concentration, thus suppressing spurious signals. Additionally, Repeat DNA-PAINT reduces photoinduced target-site loss and can accelerate sampling, all without affecting spatial resolution.},

In supercritical angle localization microscopy (SALM), z-positions of single fluorophores are extracted from the intensity of supercritical angle fluorescence, which strongly depends on their distance to the coverslip. Here, we realize the full potential of SALM and improve its z-resolution by more than four-fold compared to the state-of-the-art by directly splitting supercritical and undercritical emission, using an ultra-high NA objective, and applying fitting routines to extract precise intensities of single emitters. We demonstrate nanometer isotropic localization precision on DNA origami structures, and on clathrin coated vesicles and microtubules in cells, illustrating the potential of SALM for cell biology.},

  abstract = {Nuclear-electronic (vibronic) coupling is increasingly recognized as a mechanism of major importance in controlling the light-induced function of molecular systems. It was recently shown that infrared light excitation of intramolecular vibrations can radically change the efficiency of electron transfer, a fundamental chemical process. We now extend and generalize the understanding of this phenomenon by probing and perturbing vibronic coupling in several molecules in solution. In the experiments an ultrafast electronic-vibrational pulse sequence is applied to a range of donor-bridge-acceptor Pt(II) trans-acetylide assemblies, for which infrared excitation of selected bridge vibrations during ultraviolet-initiated charge separation alters the yields of light-induced product states. The experiments, augmented by quantum chemical calculations, reveal a complex combination of vibronic mechanisms responsible for the observed changes in electron transfer rates and pathways. The study raises new fundamental questions about the function of vibrational processes immediately following charge transfer photoexcitation, and highlights the molecular features necessary for external vibronic control of excited-state processes.},

  abstract = {Recent years have seen a tremendous interest in the bottom-up reconstitution of minimal biomolecular systems, with the ultimate aim of creating an autonomous synthetic cell. One of the universal features of living systems is cell growth, where the cell membrane expands through the incorporation of newly synthesized lipid molecules. Here, the gradual tension-mediated growth of cell-sized (≈10 µm) giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) is demonstrated, to which nanometer-sized (≈30 nm) small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) are provided, that act as a lipid source. By putting tension on the GUV membranes through a transmembrane osmotic pressure, SUV-GUV fusion events are promoted and substantial growth of the GUV is caused, even up to doubling its volume. Thus, experimental evidence is provided that membrane tension alone is sufficient to bring about membrane fusion and growth is demonstrated for both pure phospholipid liposomes and for hybrid vesicles with a mixture of phospholipids and fatty acids. The results show that growth of liposomes can be realized in a protein-free minimal system, which may find useful applications in achieving autonomous synthetic cells that are capable of undergoing a continuous growth-division cycle.},

  abstract = {Despite the potential of nanodevices for intelligent drug delivery, it remains challenging to develop controllable therapeutic devices with high spatial-temporal selectivity. Here, we report a DNA nanodevice that can achieve tumor recognition and treatment with improved spatiotemporal precision under the regulation of orthogonal near-infrared (NIR) light. The nanodevice is built by combining an ultraviolet (UV) light-activatable aptamer module and a photosensitizer (PS) with up-conversion nanoparticle (UCNP) that enables the operation of the nanodevice with deep tissue-penetrable NIR light. The UCNPs can convert two distinct NIR excitations into orthogonal UV and green emissions for programmable photoactivation of the aptamer modules and PSs, respectively, allowing spatiotemporally controlled target recognition and photodynamic antitumor effect. Furthermore, when combined with immune checkpoint blockade therapy, the nanodevice results in regression of untreated distant tumors. This work provides a new approach for regulation of diagnostic and therapeutic activity at the right time and place.},

  abstract = {Abstract             DNA is a compelling alternative to non-volatile information storage technologies due to its information density, stability, and energy efficiency. Previous studies have used artificially synthesized DNA to store data and automated next-generation sequencing to read it back. Here, we report digital Nucleic Acid Memory (dNAM) for applications that require a limited amount of data to have high information density, redundancy, and copy number. In dNAM, data is encoded by selecting combinations of single-stranded DNA with (1) or without (0) docking-site domains. When self-assembled with scaffold DNA, staple strands form DNA origami breadboards. Information encoded into the breadboards is read by monitoring the binding of fluorescent imager probes using DNA-PAINT super-resolution microscopy. To enhance data retention, a multi-layer error correction scheme that combines fountain and bi-level parity codes is used. As a prototype, fifteen origami encoded with ‘Data is in our DNA!\textbackslash n’ are analyzed. Each origami encodes unique data-droplet, index, orientation, and error-correction information. The error-correction algorithms fully recover the message when individual docking sites, or entire origami, are missing. Unlike other approaches to DNA-based data storage, reading dNAM does not require sequencing. As such, it offers an additional path to explore the advantages and disadvantages of DNA as an emerging memory material.},

  abstract = {Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) microscopy has been widely used to study the structure and dynamics of molecules of biological interest, such as nucleic acids and proteins. Single molecule FRET (sm-FRET) measurements on immobilized molecules permit long observations of the system -effectively until both dyes photobleach- resulting in time-traces that report on biomolecular dynamics with a broad range of timescales from milliseconds to minutes. To facilitate the acquisition of large number of traces for statistical analyses, the process must be automated and the sample environment should be tightly controlled over the entire measurement time (approximately 12 hours). This is accomplished using an automated scanning confocal microscope that allows the interrogation of thousands of single molecules overnight, and a microfluidic cell that permits the controlled exchange of buffer, with restricted oxygen content and maintains a constant temperature throughout the entire measuring period. Here we show how to assemble the microfluidic device and how to activate its surface for DNA immobilization. Then we explain how to prepare a buffer to maximize the photostability and lifetime of the fluorophores. Finally, we show the steps involved in preparing the setup for the automated acquisition of time-resolved single molecule FRET traces of DNA molecules.},

  abstract = {By allowing insured communication between cancer cells themselves and with the neighboring stromal cells, tunneling nanotubes (TNTs) are involved in the multistep process of cancer development from tumorigenesis to the treatment resistance. However, despite their critical role in the biology of cancer, the study of the TNTs has been announced challenging due to not only the absence of a specific biomarker but also the fragile and transitory nature of their structure and the fact that they are hovering freely above the substratum. Here, we proposed to review guidelines to follow for studying the structure and functionality of TNTs in tumoral neuroendocrine cells (PC12) and nontumorigenic human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEC-3, H28). In particular, we reported how crucial is it (i) to consider the culture conditions (culture surface, cell density), (ii) to visualize the formation of TNTs in living cells (mechanisms of formation, 3D representation), and (iii) to identify the cytoskeleton components and the associated elements (categories, origin, tip, and formation/transport) in the TNTs. We also focused on the input of high-resolution cell imaging approaches including Stimulated Emission Depletion (STED) nanoscopy, Transmitted and Scanning Electron Microscopies (TEM and SEM). In addition, we underlined the important role of the organelles in the mechanisms of TNT formation and transfer between the cancer cells. Finally, new biological models for the identification of the TNTs between cancer cells and stromal cells (liquid air interface,               ex vivo               ,               in vivo               ) and the clinical considerations will also be discussed.},

Feng               et al               . report a mechanisorption process that requires redox manipulations to pump macrocycles from bulk solution onto axles immobilized on a metal-organic framework.

Ultimately, the technique could also prove useful for actively partitioning compounds with particular functionality between surface and bulk environments. —JSY                        ,              Redox manipulations assemble rotaxanes by pumping macrocycles from bulk solution to surface-bound axles.           ,              Over the past century, adsorption has been investigated extensively in equilibrium systems, with a focus on the van der Waals interactions associated with physisorption and electronic interactions in the case of chemisorption. In this study, we demonstrate mechanisorption, which results from nonequilibrium pumping to form mechanical bonds between the adsorbent and the adsorbate. This active mode of adsorption has been realized on surfaces of metal-organic frameworks grafted with arrays of molecular pumps. Adsorbates are transported from one well-defined compartment, the bulk, to another well-defined compartment, the interface, thereby creating large potential gradients in the form of chemical capacitors wherein energy is stored in metastable states. Mechanisorption extends, in a fundamental manner, the scope and potential of adsorption phenomena and offers a transformative approach to control chemistry at surfaces and interfaces.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) enabling the investigation of individual proteins on molecular scales has revolutionized how biological processes are analysed in cells. However, a major limitation of imaging techniques reaching single-protein resolution is the incomplete and often unknown labeling and detection efficiency of the utilized molecular probes. As a result, fundamental processes such as complex formation of distinct molecular species cannot be reliably quantified. Here, we establish a super-resolution microscopy framework, called quantitative single-molecule colocalization~analysis (qSMCL), which permits the identification of absolute molecular quantities and thus the investigation of molecular-scale processes inside cells. The method combines multiplexed single-protein resolution imaging, automated cluster detection, in silico data simulation procedures, and widely applicable experimental controls to determine absolute fractions and spatial coordinates of interacting species on a true molecular level, even in highly crowded subcellular structures. The first application of this framework allowed the identification of a long-sought ternary adhesion complex—consisting of talin, kindlin and active β1-integrin—that specifically forms in cell-matrix adhesion sites. Together, the experiments demonstrate that qSMCL allows an absolute quantification of multiplexed SMLM data and thus should be useful for investigating molecular mechanisms underlying numerous processes in cells.},

  abstract = {We report superresolution optical sectioning using a multiangle total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscope. TIRF images were constructed from several layers within a normal TIRF excitation zone by sequentially imaging and photobleaching the fluorescent molecules. The depth of the evanescent wave at different layers was altered by tuning the excitation light incident angle. The angle was tuned from the highest (the smallest TIRF depth) toward the critical angle (the largest TIRF depth) to preferentially photobleach fluorescence from the lower layers and allow straightforward observation of deeper structures without masking by the brighter signals closer to the coverglass. Reconstruction of the TIRF images enabled 3D imaging of biological samples with 20-nm axial resolution. Two-color imaging of epidermal growth factor (EGF) ligand and clathrin revealed the dynamics of EGF-activated clathrin-mediated endocytosis during internalization. Furthermore, Bayesian analysis of images collected during the photobleaching step of each plane enabled lateral superresolution ({$<$}100 nm) within each of the sections.},

Here, a targeting ligand-modified DNA origami nanostructure (DON) as an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC)-like carrier for targeted prostate cancer therapy is reported. Specifically, DON of six helical bundles is modified with a ligand 2-[3-(1,3-dicarboxy propyl)-ureido] pentanedioic acid (DUPA) against prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), to serve as the antibody for drug conjugation in ADC. Doxorubicin (Dox) is then loaded to DON through intercalation to dsDNA. This platform features in spatially controllable organization of targeting ligands and high drug loading capacity. With this nanocomposite, selective delivery of Dox to the PSMA+ cancer cell line LNCaP is readily achieved. The consequent therapeutic efficacy is critically dependent on the numbers of targeting ligand assembled on DON. This target-specific and biocompatible drug delivery platform with high maximum tolerated doses shows immense potential for developing novel nanomedicine.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Despite bacterial-mediated biotherapies have been widely explored for treating different types of cancer, their implementation has been restricted by low treatment efficacy, due largely to the absence of tumor-specific accumulation following administration. Here, the conjugation of aptamers to bacterial surface is described by a simple and cytocompatible amidation procedure, which can significantly promote the localization of bacteria in tumor site after systemic administration. The surface density of aptamers can be easily adjusted by varying feed ratio and the conjugation is able to increase the stability of anchored aptamers. Optimal bacteria conjugated with an average of 2.8\,×\,10               5               aptamers per cell present the highest specificity to tumor cells in vitro, separately generating near 2- and 4-times higher accumulation in tumor tissue at 12 and 60\,hours compared to unmodified bacteria. In both 4T1 and H22 tumor-bearing mouse models, aptamer-conjugated attenuated Salmonella show enhanced antitumor efficacy, along with highly activated immune responses inside the tumor. This work demonstrates how bacterial behaviors can be tuned by surface conjugation and supports the potential of aptamer-conjugated bacteria for both targeted intratumoral localization and enhanced tumor biotherapy.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT           Several variants of multicolor single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) have been developed to resolve the spatial relationship of nanoscale structures in biological samples. The oligonucleotide-based SMLM approach ‘DNA-PAINT’ robustly achieves nanometer localization precision and can be used to count binding sites within nanostructures. However, multicolor DNA-PAINT has primarily been realized by ‘Exchange-PAINT’ that requires sequential exchange of the imaging solution and thus leads to extended acquisition times. To alleviate the need for fluid exchange and to speed up the acquisition of current multichannel DNA-PAINT, we here present a novel approach that combines DNA-PAINT with simultaneous multicolor acquisition using spectral demixing (SD). By using newly designed probes and a novel multichannel registration procedure we achieve simultaneous multicolor SD-DNA-PAINT with minimal crosstalk. We demonstrate high localization precision (3 – 6 nm) and multicolor registration of dual and triple-color SD-DNA-PAINT by resolving patterns on DNA origami nanostructures and cellular structures.},

  abstract = {Recent advancements in single-molecule-based superresolution microscopy have made it possible to visualize biological structures with unprecedented spatial resolution. Determining the spatial coorganization of these structures within cells under physiological and pathological conditions is an important biological goal. This goal has been stymied by the current limitations of carrying out superresolution microscopy in multiple colors. Here, we develop an approach for simultaneous multicolor superresolution imaging which relies solely on fluorophore excitation, rather than fluorescence emission properties. By modulating the intensity of the excitation lasers at different frequencies, we show that the color channel can be determined based on the fluorophore’s response to the modulated excitation. We use this frequency multiplexing to reduce the image acquisition time of multicolor superresolution DNA-PAINT while maintaining all its advantages: minimal color cross-talk, minimal photobleaching, maximal signal throughput, ability to maintain the fluorophore density per imaged color, and ability to use the full camera field of view. We refer to this imaging modality as “frequency multiplexed DNA-PAINT,” or fm-DNA-PAINT for short. We also show that frequency multiplexing is fully compatible with STORM superresolution imaging, which we term fm-STORM. Unlike fm-DNA-PAINT, fm-STORM is prone to color cross-talk. To overcome this caveat, we further develop a machine-learning algorithm to correct for color cross-talk with more than 95\% accuracy, without the need for prior information about the imaged structure.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Tunneling nanotubes (TNTs) are cellular extensions enabling cytosol-to-cytosol intercellular interaction between numerous cell types including macrophages. Previous studies of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) transplantation for the lysosomal storage disorder cystinosis have shown that HSPC-derived macrophages form TNTs to deliver cystinosin-bearing lysosomes to cystinotic cells, leading to tissue preservation. Here, we explored if macrophage polarization to either proinflammatory M1-like M(LPS/IFNγ) or anti-inflammatory M2-like M(IL-4/IL-10) affected TNT-like protrusion formation, intercellular transport and, ultimately, the efficacy of cystinosis prevention. We designed new automated image processing algorithms used to demonstrate that LPS/IFNγ polarization decreased bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) formation of protrusions, some of which displayed characteristics of TNTs, including cytoskeletal structure, 3D morphology and size. In contrast, co-culture of macrophages with cystinotic fibroblasts yielded more frequent and larger protrusions, as well as increased lysosomal and mitochondrial intercellular trafficking to the diseased fibroblasts. Unexpectedly, we observed normal protrusion formation and therapeutic efficacy following disruption of anti-inflammatory IL-4/IL-10 polarization               in vivo               by transplantation of HSPCs isolated from the               Rac2               −/−               mouse model. Altogether, we developed unbiased image quantification systems that probe mechanistic aspects of TNT formation and function               in vitro               , while HSPC transplantation into cystinotic mice provides a complex               in vivo               disease model. While the differences between polarization cell culture and mouse models exemplify the oversimplicity of               in vitro               cytokine treatment, they simultaneously demonstrate the utility of our co-culture model which recapitulates the               in vivo               phenomenon of diseased cystinotic cells stimulating thicker TNT formation and intercellular trafficking from macrophages. Ultimately, we can use both approaches to expand the utility of TNT-like protrusions as a delivery system for regenerative medicine.},

The influence of the four anthraquinone linkers on the i-motif thermal stability was investigated at 295 nm and pH 5.5. Anthraquinone monomers modulate the i-motif stability in a position-depending manner and the modulation also depends on the substitution pattern of the anthraquinone. The insertion of anthraquinone was found to stabilize the i-motif structure when replacing any one of the positions of the central               TAA               loop and the thermal stabilities were typically higher than those previously found for i-motifs containing pyrene-modified uracilyl unlocked nucleic acid monomers or twisted intercalating nucleic acid. The 2,6-disubstituted anthraquinone linker replacing               T               10               enabled a significant increase of i-motif thermal melting by 8.2 °C. A substantial increase of 5.0 °C in i-motif thermal melting was recorded when both               A               6               and               T               16               were modified with a double replacement by the 2,6-isomer into the               TAA               loops in the outer regions. The largest destabilization is observed for the 1,5-disubstituted anthraquinone linker upon the replacement of               A               18               . CD curves of anthraquinone-modified variants imply no structural changes in all cases under potassium buffer conditions compared with those of the native i-motif. Molecular modeling studies explained the increased thermal stabilities of anthraquinone-modified i-motifs.},

  abstract = {The trans-Golgi network (TGN) is an important cargo sorting station within the cell where newly synthesized proteins are packaged into distinct transport carriers that are targeted to various destinations. To maintain the fidelity of protein transport, elaborate protein sorting machinery is employed to mediate sorting of specific cargo proteins into distinct transport carriers. Protein sorting requires assembly of the cytosolic sorting machinery onto the TGN membrane and capture of cargo proteins. We review the cytosolic and transmembrane sorting machinery that function at the TGN and describe molecular interactions and regulatory mechanisms that enable accurate protein sorting. In addition, we highlight the importance of TGN sorting in physiology and disease.},

Confocal imaging is performed using high-affinity locked nucleic acid imaging probes that stably yet reversibly bind to oligonucleotides conjugated to antibodies and peptides. Super-resolution PAINT imaging of the same targets is performed using low-affinity DNA imaging probes to resolve nanometer-scale synaptic protein organization across nine distinct protein targets. Our approach enables the quantitative analysis of thousands of synapses in neuronal culture to identify putative synaptic sub-types and co-localization patterns from one dozen proteins. Application to characterize synaptic reorganization following neuronal activity blockade reveals coordinated upregulation of the post-synaptic proteins PSD-95, SHANK3 and Homer-1b/c, as well as increased correlation between synaptic markers in the active and synaptic vesicle zones.},

In situ sequencing (ISS) method based on padlock probes and rolling circle amplification has been used to spatially resolve gene transcripts in tissue sections of various origins. Here, we describe the next iteration of ISS, HybISS, hybridization-based in situ sequencing. Modifications in probe design allows for a new barcoding system via sequence-by-hybridization chemistry for improved spatial detection of RNA transcripts. Due to the amplification of probes, amplicons can be visualized with standard epifluorescence microscopes for high-throughput efficiency and the new sequencing chemistry removes limitations bound by sequence-by-ligation chemistry of ISS. HybISS design allows for increased flexibility and multiplexing, increased signal-to-noise, all without compromising throughput efficiency of imaging large fields of view. Moreover, the current protocol is demonstrated to work on human brain tissue samples, a source that has proven to be difficult to work with image-based spatial analysis techniques. Overall, HybISS technology works as a targeted amplification detection method for improved spatial transcriptomic visualization, and importantly, with an ease of implementation.},

Molecular structures of Piezo1 reveal a large ion channel with an unusually curved shape. This study analyzes how such a curved ion channel interacts energetically with the cell membrane. Through membrane mechanical calculations, we show that Piezo1 deforms the membrane shape outside the perimeter of the channel into a curved ‘membrane footprint’. This membrane footprint amplifies the sensitivity of Piezo1 to changes in membrane tension, rendering it exquisitely responsive. We assert that the shape of the Piezo channel is an elegant example of molecular form evolved to optimize a specific function, in this case tension sensitivity. Furthermore, the predicted influence of the membrane footprint on Piezo gating is consistent with the demonstrated importance of membrane-cytoskeletal attachments to Piezo gating.},

Despite the importance of out-of-plane components to fully understanding cell behavior, epifluorescence images are generally not used for 3D traction force microscopy (TFM) experiments due to limitations in spatial resolution and measuring out-of-plane motion. To extend an epifluorescence-based technique to 3D, we employ a topology-based single particle tracking algorithm to reconstruct high spatial-frequency 3D motion fields from densely seeded single-particle layer images. Using an open-source finite element (FE) based solver, we then compute the 3D full-field stress and strain and surface traction fields. We demonstrate this technique by measuring tractions generated by both single human neutrophils and multicellular monolayers of Madin–Darby canine kidney cells, highlighting its acuity in reconstructing both individual and collective cellular tractions. In summary, this represents a new, easily accessible method for calculating fully three-dimensional displacement and 3D surface tractions at high spatial frequency from epifluorescence images. We released and support the complete technique as a free and open-source code package.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Single molecule localization microscopy offers in principle resolution down to the molecular level, but in practice this is limited primarily by incomplete fluorescent labeling of the structure. This missing information can be completed by merging information from many structurally identical particles. In this work, we present an approach for 3D single particle analysis in localization microscopy which hugely increases signal-to-noise ratio and resolution and enables determining the symmetry groups of macromolecular complexes. Our method does not require a structural template, and handles anisotropic localization uncertainties. We demonstrate 3D reconstructions of DNA-origami tetrahedrons, Nup96 and Nup107 subcomplexes of the nuclear pore complex acquired using multiple single molecule localization microscopy techniques, with their structural symmetry deducted from the data.},

  abstract = {Protocols in the academic life science laboratory are heavily reliant on the manual manipulation of tools, reagents and instruments by a host of research staff and students. In contrast to industrial and clinical laboratory environments, the usage of automation to augment or replace manual tasks is limited. Causes of this 'automation gap' are unique to academic research, with rigid short-term funding structures, high levels of protocol variability and a benevolent culture of investment in people over equipment. Automation, however, can bestow multiple benefits through improvements in reproducibility, researcher efficiency, clinical translation, and safety. Less immediately obvious are the accompanying limitations, including obsolescence and an inhibitory effect on the freedom to innovate. Growing the range of automation options suitable for research laboratories will require more flexible, modular and cheaper designs. Academic and commercial developers of automation will increasingly need to design with an environmental awareness and an understanding that large high-tech robotic solutions may not be appropriate for laboratories with constrained financial and spatial resources. To fully exploit the potential of laboratory automation, future generations of scientists will require both engineering and biology skills. Automation in the research laboratory is likely to be an increasingly critical component of future research programs and will continue the trend of combining engineering and science expertise together to answer novel research questions.},

  abstract = {Single molecule fluorescence spectroscopy has been largely implemented using methods which require tethering of molecules to a substrate in order to make high temporal resolution measurements. However, the act of tethering a molecule requires that the molecule be removed from its environment. This is especially perturbative when measuring biomolecules such as enzymes, which may rely on the non-equilibrium and crowded cellular environment for normal function. A method which may be able to un-tether single molecule fluorescence spectroscopy is real-time 3D single particle tracking (RT-3D-SPT). RT-3D-SPT uses active feedback to effectively lock-on to freely diffusing particles so they can be measured continuously with up to photon-limited temporal resolution over large axial ranges. This review gives an overview of the various active feedback 3D single particle tracking methods, highlighting specialized detection and excitation schemes which enable high-speed real-time tracking. Furthermore, the combination of these active feedback methods with simultaneous live-cell imaging is discussed. Finally, the successes in real-time 3D single molecule tracking (RT-3D-SMT) thus far and the roadmap going forward for this promising family of techniques are discussed.},

Here, we present a 3D single-molecule active real-time tracking method (3D-SMART) which is capable of locking on to single fluorophores in solution for minutes at a time with photon limited temporal resolution. As a demonstration, 3D-SMART is applied to actively track single Atto 647\,N fluorophores in 90\% glycerol solution with an average duration of \textasciitilde 16\,s at count rates of \textasciitilde 10\,kHz. Active feedback tracking is further applied to single proteins and nucleic acids, directly measuring the diffusion of various lengths (99 to 1385\,bp) of single DNA molecules at rates up to 10\,µm               2               /s. In addition, 3D-SMART is able to quantify the occupancy of single Spinach2 RNA aptamers and capture active transcription on single freely diffusing DNA. 3D-SMART represents a critical step towards the untethering of single molecule spectroscopy.},

  abstract = {Micro/nanorobot, as a research field, has attracted interest in recent years. It has great potential in medical treatment, as it can be applied in targeted drug delivery, surgical operation, disease diagnosis, etc. Differently from traditional drug delivery, which relies on blood circulation to reach the target, the designed micro/nanorobots can move autonomously, which makes it possible to deliver drugs to the hard-to-reach areas. Micro/nanorobots were driven by exogenous power (magnetic fields, light energy, acoustic fields, electric fields, etc.) or endogenous power (chemical reaction energy). Cell-based micro/nanorobots and DNA origami without autonomous movement ability were also introduced in this article. Although micro/nanorobots have excellent prospects, the current research is mainly based on in vitro experiments; in vivo research is still in its infancy. Further biological experiments are required to verify in vivo drug delivery effects of micro/nanorobots. This paper mainly discusses the research status, challenges, and future development of micro/nanorobots.},

Their small size and high diversity have made it challenging to develop detection methods that have sufficient resolution and specificity to multiplex and quantify. We created a method, sRNA-PAINT, for the detection of small RNAs with 20 nm resolution by combining the super-resolution method, DNA-based points accumulation in nanoscale topography (DNA-PAINT), and the specificity of locked nucleic acid (LNA) probes for the in situ detection of multiple small RNAs. The method relies on designing probes to target small RNAs that combine DNA oligonucleotides (oligos) for PAINT with LNA-containing oligos for hybridization; therefore, we developed an online tool called ‘Vetting \& Analysis of RNA for in situ Hybridization probes’ (VARNISH) for probe design. Our method utilizes advances in DNA-PAINT methodologies, including qPAINT for quantification, and Exchange-PAINT for multiplexing. We demonstrated these capabilities of sRNA-PAINT by detecting and quantifying small RNAs in different cell layers of early developmental stage maize anthers that are important for male sexual reproduction.},

Here, we discover that both thiolated and non-thiolated DNA/RNA can be efficiently attached to AuNPs to achieve high-stable spherical nucleic acid (SNA) within minutes under a domestic microwave (MW)-assisted heating-dry circumstance. Further studies show that for non-thiolated DNA/RNA the conjugation is poly (T/U) tag dependent. Spectroscopy, test strip hybridization, and loading counting experiments indicate that low-affinity poly (T/U) tag mediates the formation of a standing-up conformation, which is distributed in the outer layer of SNA structure. In further application studies, CRISPR/Cas9-sgRNA (136\,bp), SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragment (1278\,bp), and rolling circle amplification (RCA) DNA products (over 1000\,bp) can be successfully attached on AuNPs, which overcomes the routine methods in long-chain nucleic acid-AuNP conjugation, exhibiting great promise in biosensing and nucleic acids delivery applications. Current heating-dry strategy has improved traditional DNA/RNA-AuNP conjugation methods in simplicity, rapidity, cost, and universality.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Mechanosensitive Piezo1 channels are essential mechanotransduction proteins in eukaryotes. Their curved transmembrane domains, called arms, create a convex membrane deformation, or footprint, which is predicted to flatten in response to increased membrane tension. Here, using a hyperbolic tangent model, we show that, due to the intrinsic bending rigidity of the membrane, the overlap of neighboring Piezo1 footprints produces a flattening of the Piezo1 footprints and arms. Multiple all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of Piezo1 further reveal that this tension-independent flattening is accompanied by gating motions that open an activation gate in the pore. This open state recapitulates experimentally obtained ionic selectivity, unitary conductance, and mutant phenotypes. Tracking ion permeation along the open pore reveals the presence of intracellular and extracellular fenestrations acting as cation-selective sites. Simulations also reveal multiple potential binding sites for phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. We propose that the overlap of Piezo channel footprints may act as a cooperative mechanism to regulate channel activity.},

  abstract = {Nanorobots are safe and exhibit powerful functionalities, including delivery, therapy, and diagnosis. Therefore, they are in high demand for the development of new cancer therapies. Although many studies have contributed to the progressive development of the nanorobot system for anticancer drug delivery, these systems still face some critical limitations, such as potentially toxic materials in the nanorobots, unreasonable sizes for passive targeting, and the lack of several essential functions of the nanorobot for anticancer drug delivery including sensing, active targeting, controlling drug release, and sufficient drug loading capacity. Here, we developed a multifunctional nanorobot system capable of precise magnetic control, sufficient drug loading for chemotherapy, light-triggered controlled drug release, light absorption for photothermal therapy, enhanced magnetic resonance imaging, and tumor sensing. The developed nanorobot system exhibits an in vitro synergetic antitumor effect of photothermal therapy and chemotherapy and outstanding tumor-targeting efficiency in both in vitro and in vivo environments. The results of this study encourage further explorations of an efficient active drug delivery system for cancer treatment and the development of nanorobot systems for other biomedical applications.},

  abstract = {Synthetic nano/micro/millimeter-sized machines that harvest energy from the surrounding environment and then convert it to motion have had a significant impact on many research areas such as biology (sensing, imaging, and therapy) and environmental applications. Autonomous motion is a key element of these devices. A high surface area is preferable as it leads to increased propellant or cargo-loading capability. Integrating highly ordered and porous metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with self-propelled machines is demonstrated to have a significant impact on the field of nano/micro/millimeter-sized devices for a wide range of applications. MOFs have shown great potential in many research fields due to their tailorable pore size. These fields include energy storage and conversion; catalysis, biomedical application (e.g., drug delivery, imaging, and cancer therapy), and environmental remediation. The marriage of motors and MOFs may provide opportunities for many new applications for synthetic nano/micro/millimeter-sized machines. Herein, MOF-based micro- and nanomachines are reviewed with a focus on the specific properties of MOFs.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Understanding the nano-architecture of protein machines in diverse subcellular compartments remains a challenge despite rapid progress in super-resolution microscopy. While single-molecule localization microscopy techniques allow the visualization and identification of cellular structures with near-molecular resolution, multiplex-labeling of tens of target proteins within the same sample has not yet been achieved routinely. However, single sample multiplexing is essential to detect patterns that threaten to get lost in multi-sample averaging. Here, we report maS               3               TORM (multiplexed automated serial staining stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy), a microscopy approach capable of fully automated 3D direct STORM (               d               STORM) imaging and solution exchange employing a re-staining protocol to achieve highly multiplexed protein localization within individual biological samples. We demonstrate 3D super-resolution images of 15 targets in single cultured cells and 16 targets in individual neuronal tissue samples with {$<$}10\,nm localization precision, allowing us to define distinct nano-architectural features of protein distribution within the presynaptic nerve terminal.},

Remarkably,               Escherichia coli               grows in minimal medium over a wide range of external osmolalities (0.03 to 1.8 osmol). The mean cytoplasmic biopolymer volume fraction (〈φ〉) for such adapted cells ranges from 0.16 at 0.10 osmol to 0.36 at 1.45 osmol. For cells grown at 0.28 osmol, a similar 〈φ〉 range is obtained by plasmolysis (sudden osmotic upshift) using NaCl or sucrose as the external osmolyte, after which the only available cellular response is passive loss of cytoplasmic water. Here we measure the effective axial diffusion coefficient of green fluorescent protein (               D               GFP               ) in the cytoplasm of               E. coli               cells as a function of 〈φ〉 for both plasmolyzed and adapted cells. For plasmolyzed cells, the median               D               GFP               (                                \textbackslash batchmode \textbackslash documentclass[fleqn,10pt,legalpaper]\{article\} \textbackslash usepackage\{amssymb\} \textbackslash usepackage\{amsfonts\} \textbackslash usepackage\{amsmath\} \textbackslash pagestyle\{empty\} \textbackslash begin\{document\} \textbackslash (D\_\{GFP\}\^\{m\}\textbackslash ) \textbackslash end\{document\}                              ) decreases by a factor of 70 as 〈φ〉 increases from 0.16 to 0.33. In sharp contrast, for adapted cells,                                \textbackslash batchmode \textbackslash documentclass[fleqn,10pt,legalpaper]\{article\} \textbackslash usepackage\{amssymb\} \textbackslash usepackage\{amsfonts\} \textbackslash usepackage\{amsmath\} \textbackslash pagestyle\{empty\} \textbackslash begin\{document\} \textbackslash (D\_\{GFP\}\^\{m\}\textbackslash ) \textbackslash end\{document\}                              decreases only by a factor of 2.1 as 〈φ〉 increases from 0.16 to 0.36. Clearly, GFP diffusion is not determined by 〈φ〉 alone. By comparison with quantitative models, we show that the data cannot be explained by crowding theory. We suggest possible underlying causes of this surprising effect and further experiments that will help choose among competing hypotheses. Recovery of the ability of proteins to diffuse in the cytoplasm after plasmolysis may well be a key determinant of the time scale of the recovery of growth.},

  abstract = {The building blocks of the nanostructures observed onDrosophilacorneas are determined, and then used to create artificial nanostructures with anti-reflective and anti-adhesive properties. Insect eyes have an anti-reflective coating, owing to nanostructures on the corneal surface creating a gradient of refractive index between that of air and that of the lens material(1,2). These nanocoatings have also been shown to provide anti-adhesive functionality(3). The morphology of corneal nanocoatings are very diverse in arthropods, with nipple-like structures that can be organized into arrays or fused into ridge-like structures(4). This diversity can be attributed to a reaction-diffusion mechanism(4)and patterning principles developed by Alan Turing(5), which have applications in numerous biological settings(6). The nanocoatings on insect corneas are one example of such Turing patterns, and the first known example of nanoscale Turing patterns(4). Here we demonstrate a clear link between the morphology and function of the nanocoatings onDrosophilacorneas. We find that nanocoatings that consist of individual protrusions have better anti-reflective properties, whereas partially merged structures have better anti-adhesion properties. We use biochemical analysis and genetic modification techniques to reverse engineer the protein Retinin and corneal waxes as the building blocks of the nanostructures. In the context of Turing patterns, these building blocks fulfil the roles of activator and inhibitor, respectively. We then establish low-cost production of Retinin, and mix this synthetic protein with waxes to forward engineer various artificial nanocoatings with insect-like morphology and anti-adhesive or anti-reflective function. Our combined reverse- and forward-engineering approach thus provides a way to economically produce functional nanostructured coatings from biodegradable materials.},

  abstract = {i-motif is cytosine (C)-rich oligonucleotide (ODN) which shows pH-responsive structure change in acidic condition. Therefore, it has been utilized for the trigger of intercalated drug release, responding to environmental pH change. In this study, 2.76 molecules of i-motif binding ODNs (IBOs) were conjugated to each hyaluronic acid (HA) via amide bond linkages. Synthesis of HA-IBO conjugate (HB) was confirmed by FT-IR and agarose gel electrophoresis with Stains-All staining. After hybridization of HB with i-motif ODN (IMO), it was confirmed that doxorubicin (DOX) could be loaded in HB-IMO hybrid structure (HBIM) with 65.6\% of drug loading efficiency (DLE) and 25.0\% of drug loading content (DLC). At pH 5.5, prompt and significant DOX release from HBIM was observed due to the disruption of HBIM hybrid structure via i-motif formation of IMO, contrary to pH 7.4 condition. Then, HBIM was complexed with low molecular weight polyethylenimine (PEI1.8k), forming positively charged nanostructures (Z-average size: 126.0 ± 0.4 nm, zeta-potential: 16.1 ± 0.3 mV). DOX-loaded HBIM/PEI complexes displayed higher anticancer efficacy than free DOX in A549 cells, showing the potential for pH-responsive anticancer drug delivery systems.},

According to the fact that a hybrid molecule with a relatively rigid structure shows a more obvious AIE effect, and whose nano-sized aggregates are formed at a high concentration, we assume that the solubility of the hybrid molecule in water will be reduced due to IFS folding, resulting in aggregation and the resultant AIE effect. Finally, due to its excellent pH responsiveness, this DNA-based probe employing an AIEgen has been applied in monitoring intracellular pH.},

  abstract = {CONSPECTUS: The past decades have witnessed the development of a field dedicated to targeting tumor vasculature for cancer therapy. In contrast to conventional chemotherapeutics that need to penetrate into tumor tissues for killing tumor cells, the agents targeting tumor vascular system have two major advantages: direct contact with vascular endothelial cells or the blood and less possibility to induce drug resistance because of high gene stability of endothelial cells. More specifically, various angiogenesis inhibitors (AIs) and vascular disrupting agents (VDAs) that block tumor blood supply to inhibit tumor progression, some of which have been applied clinically, have been described. However, off-target effects and high effective doses limit the utility of these formulations in cancer patients. Thus, new strategies with improved therapeutic efficacy and safety are needed for tumor vessel targeting therapy. With the burgeoning developments in nanotechnology, smart nanotherapeutics now offer unprecedented potential for targeting tumor vasculature. Based on specific structural and functional features of the tumor vasculature, a number of different nanoscale delivery systems have been proposed for cancer therapy. In this Account, we summarize several distinct strategies to modulate tumor vasculature with various smart nanotherapeutics for safe and effective tumor therapy developed by our research programs. Inspired by the blood coagulation cascade, we generated nanoparticle-mediated tumor vessel infarction strategies that selectively block tumor blood supply to starve the tumor to death. By specifically delivering thrombin loaded DNA nanorobots (Nanorobot-Th) into tumor vessels, an intratumoral thrombosis is triggered to induce vascular infarction and, ultimately, tumor necrosis. Mimicking the coagulation cascade, a smart polymeric nanogel achieves permanent and peripheral embolization of liver tumors. Considering the critical role of platelets in maintaining tumor vessel integrity, a hybrid (PLP-D-R) nanoparticle selectively depleting tumor-associated platelets (TAP) to boost tumor vessel permeability was developed for enhancing intratumoral drug accumulation. In addition, benefiting from a better understanding of the molecular and cellular underpinnings of vascular normalization, several tumor acidity responsive nanotherapeutics, encapsulating therapeutic peptides, and small interfering RNA were developed to correct the abnormal features of the tumor vasculature. This made the tumor vessels more efficient for drug delivery. While we are still exploring the mechanisms of action of these novel nanoformulations, we expect that the strategies summarized here will offer a promising platform to design effective next-generation nanotherapeutics against cancer and facilitate the clinical translation of smart nanotherapeutics that target tumor vasculature.},

Here, we use deep learning to develop a rapid, automatic SMFM trace selector, termed AutoSiM, that improves the sensitivity and specificity of an assay for a DNA point mutation based on single-molecule recognition through equilibrium Poisson sampling (SiMREPS). The improved performance of AutoSiM is based on accepting both more true positives and fewer false positives than the conventional approach of hidden Markov modeling (HMM) followed by hard thresholding. As a second application, the selector is used for automated screening of single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) data to identify high-quality traces for further analysis, and achieves \textasciitilde 90\% concordance with manual selection while requiring less processing time. Finally, we show that AutoSiM can be adapted readily to novel datasets, requiring only modest Transfer Learning.},

Here we use cryo-electron microscopy to show that PIEZO1 adopts different degrees of curvature in lipid vesicles of different sizes. We also use high-speed atomic force microscopy to analyse the deformability of PIEZO1 under force in membranes on a mica surface, and show that PIEZO1 can be flattened reversibly into the membrane plane. By approximating the absolute force applied, we estimate a range of values for the mechanical spring constant of PIEZO1. Both methods of microscopy demonstrate that PIEZO1 can deform its shape towards a planar structure. This deformation could explain how lateral membrane tension can be converted into a conformation-dependent change in free energy to gate the PIEZO1 channel in response to mechanical perturbations.},

In our design, the branched DNA structure can efficiently load a sgRNA/Cas9/antisense complex targeting a tumor-associated gene, PLK1, through DNA self-assembly. With the incorporation of an active targeting aptamer and an endosomal escape peptide by host-guest interaction, the biocompatible DNA nanoplatform demonstrates efficient inhibition of tumor growth without apparent systemic toxicity. This multifunctional DNA nanocarrier provides a new strategy for the development of gene therapeutics.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Cell membrane coated nanoparticles (NPs) have recently been recognized as attractive nanomedical tools because of their unique properties such as immune escape, long blood circulation time, specific molecular recognition and cell targeting. However, the integrity of the cell membrane coating on NPs, a key metrics related to the quality of these biomimetic-systems and their resulting biomedical function, has remained largely unexplored. Here, we report a fluorescence quenching assay to probe the integrity of cell membrane coating. In contradiction to the common assumption of perfect coating, we uncover that up to 90\% of the biomimetic NPs are only partially coated. Using in vitro homologous targeting studies, we demonstrate that partially coated NPs could still be internalized by the target cells. By combining molecular simulations with experimental analysis, we further identify an endocytic entry mechanism for these NPs. We unravel that NPs with a high coating degree (≥50\%) enter the cells individually, whereas the NPs with a low coating degree ({$<$}50\%) need to aggregate together before internalization. This quantitative method and the fundamental understanding of how cell membrane coated NPs enter the cells will enhance the rational designing of biomimetic nanosystems and pave the way for more effective cancer nanomedicine.},

After a functional aptamer is covalently anchored onto the corresponding target protein on a living cell through UV irradiation, azide-Cy3-C               x               is conjugated with the aptamer through a click reaction to produce a “tug-of-war” between the MDM and the cell due to the buoyancy of the silica bubble. This induces the detachment of the protein from the cell membrane or the alkane terminal from the MDM enabling sub-piconewton embedding force measurement by changing the alkane chain length and simple fluorescence analysis. The successful analysis of embedding force variation of a protein on the cell membrane upon post-translational modifications demonstrates the practicability and expansibility of this method for mechanics-related research in biological systems.},

  abstract = {A DNA nanodevice vaccine has been developed and utilized to stimulate a tumour-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte response in vivo, leading to the inhibition of tumour growth as well as prevention of metastasis. A major challenge in cancer vaccine therapy is the efficient delivery of antigens and adjuvants to stimulate a controlled yet robust tumour-specific T-cell response. Here, we describe a structurally well defined DNA nanodevice vaccine generated by precisely assembling two types of molecular adjuvants and an antigen peptide within the inner cavity of a tubular DNA nanostructure that can be activated in the subcellular environment to trigger T-cell activation and cancer cytotoxicity. The integration of low pH-responsive DNA 'locking strands' outside the nanostructures enables the opening of the vaccine in lysosomes in antigen-presenting cells, exposing adjuvants and antigens to activate a strong immune response. The DNA nanodevice vaccine elicited a potent antigen-specific T-cell response, with subsequent tumour regression in mouse cancer models. Nanodevice vaccination generated long-term T-cell responses that potently protected the mice against tumour rechallenge.},

Recent progress on immuno-nucleic acid amplification technology presents tremendous opportunities to address this issue. Here, we report an innovative hybridization chain reaction (HCR) technique that involves computer-aided design (CAD) and reversible assembly. CAD enables highly multiplexed HCR with a sequence database that can work in parallel, while reversible assembly enables the switching of HCR between a working state and a resting state. Thus, CAD-HCR has been successfully adopted for single-cell spatial proteomics analysis. The fluorescence signal of CAD-HCR is comparable with conventional immunofluorescence, and it is positively correlated with the abundance of target proteins, which is beneficial for the visualization of proteins. The method developed here expands the toolbox of single-cell analysis and proteomics studies, as well as the performance and application of HCR.},

DNA nanostructures have been considered one of the most promising nanocarriers. In the present study, we report a DNA framework-based intelligent DNA nanorobot for selective lysosomal degradation of tumor-specific proteins on cancer cells. We site-specifically anchored an anti-HER2 aptamer (HApt) on a tetrahedral framework nucleic acid (tFNA). This DNA nanorobot (HApt-tFNA) could target HER2-positive breast cancer cells and specifically induce the lysosomal degradation of the membrane protein HER2. An injection of the DNA nanorobot into a mouse model revealed that the presence of tFNA enhanced the stability and prolonged the blood circulation time of HApt, and HApt-tFNA could therefore drive HER2 into lysosomal degradation with a higher efficiency. The formation of the HER2-HApt-tFNA complexes resulted in the HER2-mediated endocytosis and digestion in lysosomes, which effectively reduced the amount of HER2 on the cell surfaces. An increased HER2 digestion through HApt-tFNA further induced cell apoptosis and arrested cell growth. Hence, this novel DNA nanorobot sheds new light on targeted protein degradation for precision breast cancer therapy.},

The spectra are simulated in all their components, namely the energy position and the lineshapes of both the far-red and the blue bands. To achieve such a goal, we have combined a 4.5 μs MD simulation of the solvated dimeric phytochrome with a hybrid quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) model, which accounts for both electrostatic and mutual polarization effects between the QM and the MM subsystems. A good agreement with experiments is found for all the three spectra. Moreover, we find a transient H-bond network within the binding pocket of the biliverdin chromophore that, unexpectedly, does not significantly affect the spectra. In parallel, we characterize the vibrations that are more strongly coupled to the biliverdin excitation, confirming the important role of the hydrogen-out-of-plane mode of its vinyl C–H together with the expected CC stretching of the double bond involved in the photoisomerization.},

Our ability to rationally engineer this potentially useful property into normally non-allosteric catalysts, however, remains limited. In response we report a DNA nanotechnology-enabled approach for introducing allostery into catalytic nucleic acids. Specifically, we have grafted one or two copies of a peroxidase-like DNAzyme, hemin-bound G-quadruplex (hemin-G), onto a DNA tetrahedral nanostructure in such a manner as to cause them to interact, modulating their catalytic activity. We achieve allosteric regulation of these catalysts by incorporating dynamically responsive oligonucleotides that respond to specific “effector” molecules (complementary oligonucleotides or small molecules), altering the spacing between the catalytic sites and thus regulating their activity. This designable approach thus enables subtle allosteric modulation in DNAzymes that is potentially of use for nanomedicine and nanomachines.},

The most common failure modes are the biases and errors produced by the localisation algorithm when there is emitter overlap. Also known as the high density or crowded field condition, significant emitter overlap is normally unavoidable in live cell imaging. Here we use Haar wavelet kernel analysis (HAWK), a localisation microscopy data analysis method which is known to produce results without bias, to generate a reference image. This enables mapping and quantification of reconstruction bias and artefacts common in all but low emitter density data. By avoiding comparisons involving intensity information, we can map structural artefacts in a way that is not adversely influenced by nonlinearity in the localisation algorithm. The HAWK Method for the Assessment of Nanoscopy (HAWKMAN) is a general approach which allows for the reliability of localisation information to be assessed.},

Fluorescence correlation and cross-correlation spectroscopy (FCS and FCCS) are appealing technologies to study these macromolecular structures because they have single molecule sensitivity and readily provide information about their molecular composition and dynamics. Here, we demonstrate how FCS can be exploited to study cytoplasmic mRNPs with high accuracy and reproducibility in cell lysates. Cellular lysates not only recapitulate data from live cells but provide improved readings and allow investigation of single mRNP analysis under particular conditions or following enzymatic treatments. Moreover, FCCS employing minute amounts of cells closely corroborated previously reported RNA dependent interactions and provided estimates of the relative overlap between factors in the mRNPs, thus depicting their heterogeneity. The described lysate-based FCS and FCCS analysis may not only complement current biochemical approaches but also provide novel opportunities for the quantitative analysis of the molecular composition and dynamics of single mRNPs.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The cytosine (C)-rich sequences that can fold into tetraplex structures known as i-motif are prevalent in genomic DNA. Recent studies of i-motif–forming sequences have shown increasing evidence of their roles in gene regulation. However, most of these studies have been performed in short single-stranded oligonucleotides, far from the intracellular environment. In cells, i-motif–forming sequences are flanked by DNA duplexes and packed in the genome. Therefore, exploring the conformational dynamics and kinetics of i-motif under such topologically constrained environments is highly relevant in predicting their biological roles. Using single-molecule fluorescence analysis of self-assembled DNA duplexes and nanocircles, we show that the topological environments play a key role on i-motif stability and dynamics. While the human telomere sequence (C3TAA)3C3 assumes i-motif structure at pH 5.5 regardless of topological constraint, it undergoes conformational dynamics among unfolded, partially folded and fully folded states at pH 6.5. The lifetimes of i-motif and the partially folded state at pH 6.5 were determined to be 6 ± 2 and 31 ± 11 s, respectively. Consistent with the partially folded state observed in fluorescence analysis, interrogation of current versus time traces obtained from nanopore analysis at pH 6.5 shows long-lived shallow blockades with a mean lifetime of 25 ± 6 s. Such lifetimes are sufficient for the i-motif and partially folded states to interact with proteins to modulate cellular processes.},

Moreover, this knowledge must then be harnessed in innovative ways to improve existing DNA nanostructures and design new ones, so that they can perform more diverse functions more effectively. There have been many developments in this regard in the past few years, and herein some of these are highlighted, with respect to both works that improve our understanding of what happens to DNA nanostructures once they are at their target site, and those that utilise clever design to accomplish desired functions.},

  abstract = {Biomolecular self-assemblies are of great interest to nanotechnologists because of their functional versatility and their biocompatibility(1). Over the past decade, sophisticated single-component nanostructures composed exclusively of nucleic acids(2-5), peptides(6-8) and proteins(9-15) have been reported, and these nanostructures have been used in a wide range of applications, from drug delivery(16) to molecular computing(17). Despite these successes, the development of hybrid co-assemblies of nucleic acids and proteins has remained elusive. Here we use computational protein design to create a protein-DNA co-assembling nanomaterial whose assembly is driven via non-covalent interactions. To achieve this, a homodimerization interface is engineered onto the Drosophila Engrailed homeodomain (ENH), allowing the dimerized protein complex to bind to two double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) molecules. By varying the arrangement of protein-binding sites on the dsDNA, an irregular bulk nanoparticle or a nanowire with single-molecule width can be spontaneously formed by mixing the protein and dsDNA building blocks. We characterize the protein-DNA nanowire using fluorescence microscopy, atomic force microscopy and X-ray crystallography, confirming that the nanowire is formed via the proposed mechanism. This work lays the foundation for the development of new classes of protein-DNA hybrid materials. Further applications can be explored by incorporating DNA origami, DNA aptamers and/or peptide epitopes into the protein-DNA framework presented here.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Single-stranded telomeric overhangs are ∼200 nucleotides long and can form tandem G-quadruplex (GQ) structures, which reduce their accessibility to nucleases and proteins that activate DNA damage response. Whether these tandem GQs further stack to form compact superstructures, which may provide better protection for longer telomeres, is not known. We report single-molecule measurements where the accessibility of 24–144 nucleotide long human telomeric DNA molecules is interrogated by a short PNA molecule that is complementary to a single GGGTTA repeat, as implemented in the FRET-PAINT method. Binding of the PNA strand to available GGGTTA sequences results in discrete FRET bursts which were analyzed in terms of their dwell times, binding frequencies, and topographic distributions. The binding frequencies were greater for binding to intermediate regions of telomeric DNA compared to 3′- or 5′-ends, suggesting these regions are more accessible. Significantly, the binding frequency per telomeric repeat monotonically decreased with increasing telomere length. These results are consistent with telomeres forming more compact structures at longer lengths, reducing accessibility of these critical genomic sites.},

  abstract = {Abstract             High-resolution live-cell imaging is necessary to study complex biological phenomena. Modern fluorescence microscopy methods are increasingly combined with complementary, label-free techniques to put the fluorescence information into the cellular context. The most common high-resolution imaging approaches used in combination with fluorescence imaging are electron microscopy and atomic-force microscopy (AFM), originally developed for solid-state material characterization. AFM routinely resolves atomic steps, however on soft biological samples, the forces between the tip and the sample deform the fragile membrane, thereby distorting the otherwise high axial resolution of the technique. Here we present scanning ion-conductance microscopy (SICM) as an alternative approach for topographical imaging of soft biological samples, preserving high axial resolution on cells. SICM is complemented with live-cell compatible super-resolution optical fluctuation imaging (SOFI). To demonstrate the capabilities of our method we show correlative 3D cellular maps with SOFI implementation in both 2D and 3D with self-blinking dyes for two-color high-order SOFI imaging. Finally, we employ correlative SICM/SOFI microscopy for visualizing actin dynamics in live COS-7 cells with subdiffraction-resolution.},

  abstract = {Single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) is a powerful tool for studying intracellular structure and macromolecular organization at the nanoscale. The increasingly massive pointillistic data sets generated by SMLM require the development of new and highly efficient quantification tools. Here we present FOCAL3D, an accurate, flexible and exceedingly fast (scaling linearly with the number of localizations) density-based algorithm for quantifying spatial clustering in large 3D SMLM data sets. Unlike DBSCAN, which is perhaps the most commonly employed density-based clustering algorithm, an optimum set of parameters for FOCAL3D may be objectively determined. We initially validate the performance of FOCAL3D on simulated datasets at varying noise levels and for a range of cluster sizes. These simulated datasets are used to illustrate the parametric insensitivity of the algorithm, in contrast to DBSCAN, and clustering metrics such as the F1 and Silhouette score indicate that FOCAL3D is highly accurate, even in the presence of significant background noise and mixed populations of variable sized clusters, once optimized. We then apply FOCAL3D to 3D astigmatic dSTORM images of the nuclear pore complex (NPC) in human osteosaracoma cells, illustrating both the validity of the parameter optimization and the ability of the algorithm to accurately cluster complex, heterogeneous 3D clusters in a biological dataset. FOCAL3D is provided as an open source software package written in Python.},

LIVE-PAINT works by observing the blinking of localized fluorescence as this peptide is reversibly bound by a protein that is fused to a fluorescent protein. We have demonstrated the effectiveness of LIVE-PAINT by imaging a number of different proteins inside live               S. cerevisiae               . Not only is LIVE-PAINT widely applicable, easily implemented, and the modifications minimally perturbing, but we also anticipate it will extend data acquisition times compared to those previously possible with methods that involve direct fusion to a fluorescent protein.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Ligand binding to membrane proteins is critical for many biological signaling processes. However, individual binding events are rarely directly observed, and their asynchronous dynamics are occluded in ensemble-averaged measures. For membrane proteins, single-molecule approaches that resolve these dynamics are challenged by dysfunction in non-native lipid environments, lack of access to intracellular sites, and costly sample preparation. Here, we introduce an approach combining cell-derived nanovesicles, microfluidics, and single-molecule fluorescence colocalization microscopy to track individual binding events at a cyclic nucleotide-gated TAX-4 ion channel critical for sensory transduction. Our observations reveal dynamics of both nucleotide binding and a subsequent conformational change likely preceding pore opening. Kinetic modeling suggests that binding of the second ligand is either independent of the first ligand or exhibits up to \textasciitilde 10-fold positive binding cooperativity. This approach is broadly applicable to studies of binding dynamics for proteins with extracellular or intracellular domains in native cell membrane.},

These synthetic motor systems, with rapid transporting and efficient cargo towing abilities, are expected to open up new horizons for various applications. Utilizing emergent motor platforms for in vivo applications is one important aspect receiving growing interest as conventional therapeutic methodology still remains limited for cancer, heart, or vasculature diseases. In this review we will highlight the recent efforts towards realistic in vivo application of various motor systems. With ever booming research enthusiasm in this field and increasing multidisciplinary cooperation, micro/ nanomotors with integrated multifunctionality and selectivity are on their way to revolutionize clinical practice.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Innovations in high-resolution optical imaging have allowed visualization of nanoscale biological structures and connections. However, super-resolution fluorescence techniques, including both optics-oriented and sample-expansion based, are limited in quantification and throughput especially in tissues from photobleaching or quenching of the fluorophores, and low-efficiency or non-uniform delivery of the probes. Here, we report a general sample-expansion vibrational imaging strategy, termed VISTA, for scalable label-free high-resolution interrogations of protein-rich biological structures with resolution down to 78\,nm. VISTA achieves decent three-dimensional image quality through optimal retention of endogenous proteins, isotropic sample expansion, and deprivation of scattering lipids. Free from probe-labeling associated issues, VISTA offers unbiased and high-throughput tissue investigations. With correlative VISTA and immunofluorescence, we further validated the imaging specificity of VISTA and trained an image-segmentation model for label-free multi-component and volumetric prediction of nucleus, blood vessels, neuronal cells and dendrites in complex mouse brain tissues. VISTA could hence open new avenues for versatile biomedical studies.},

We have also calculated vertical electronic transition energies and determined the nature of the corresponding excited states in a model tetramer i-motif structure. Quantum chemical calculations of the excitation spectrum of a tetramer i-motif structure predict a significant (0.3\,eV) red shift of the lowest-energy transition in the i-motif form relative to its absorption maximum, which agrees with the experimental absorption spectrum. The lowest excitonic state in i-(dC)               10               is responsible for a 2\,ps red-shifted emission at 370\,nm observed in the decay-associated spectra obtained on the femtosecond time-scale. This delocalized (excitonic) excited state is likely a precursor to a long-lived excimer state observed in previous studies. Another fast 310\,fs component at 330\,nm is assigned to a monomer-like locally excited state. Both emissive states form within less than the available time resolution of the instrument (100\,fs). This work contributes to the understanding of excited-state dynamics of DNA within the first few picoseconds, which is the most interesting time range with respect to unraveling the photodamage mechanism, including the formation of the most dangerous DNA lesions such as cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers.},

However, in practice it is not always easy to ascertain whether the carbonyl or nitrile group in question is engaged in such interactions. Herein, we use 4-cyanoindole and cyclopentanone as models to show that, when a fundamental CO or CN stretching mode is involved in Fermi resonance, the underlying vibrational coupling constant (               W               ) is a convenient reporter of the hydrogen-bonding status of the corresponding carbonyl or nitrile group. Specifically, we find that for both groups a               W               value of 7.7 cm               −1               or greater is indicative of their involvement in hydrogen-bonding interactions. Furthermore, we find that, as observed in similar studies, the Fermi resonance coupling leads to quantum beats in the two-dimensional infrared spectra of 4-cyanoindole in isopropanol, with a period of about 1.9 ps.},

  abstract = {Cell-to-cell communication is a crucial prerequisite for the development and maintenance of multicellular organisms. To date, diverse mechanisms of intercellular exchange of information have been documented, including chemical synapses, gap junctions, and plasmodesmata. Here, we describe highly sensitive nanotubular structures formed de novo between cells that create complex networks. These structures facilitate the selective transfer of membrane vesicles and organelles but seem to impede the flow of small molecules. Accordingly, we propose a novel biological principle of cell-to-cell interaction based on membrane continuity and intercellular transfer of organelles.},

  abstract = {Osmotic pressure (Π) induces membrane tension in cell membranes and the lipid bilayers of vesicles and plays an important role in the functions and physical properties of these membranes. We recently developed a method to determine quantitatively the membrane tension of giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) under Π and applied it to GUVs comprising electrically neutral dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC). Here, we examined the effect of Π on GUVs composed of DOPC and negatively charged dioleoylphosphatidylglycerol (DOPG) in a buffer containing a physiological concentration of ions. First, we examined the rate constant, kr, for constant tension (σex)-induced rupture of DOPG/DOPC (4/6)-GUVs under Π and obtained the dependence of kr on σex in GUVs for various values of Π. Comparing this dependence in the absence of Π provided values for membrane tension due to Π, σosm, which agree with the theoretical values within the experimental error. The values of σosm for DOPG/DOPC-GUVs were smaller than those for DOPC-GUVs under the same Π. Two factors, that is, the solute concentration in a GUV suspension and the elastic modulus of the GUV membrane, can reasonably explain this difference based on the theory of σosm. We also examined the effect of Π on the rate constant, kFF, for the transbilayer movement of lipid molecules in single GUVs. The values of kFF increased with increasing Π, indicating that kFF increased with σosm. This result supports the existence of prepores in stretched lipid bilayers. Based on these results, we discuss the membrane tension of DOPG/DOPC-GUVs under Π.},

  abstract = {Engineered molecular circuits that process information in biological systems could address emerging human health and biomanufacturing needs. However, such circuits can be difficult to rationally design and scale. DNA-based strand displacement reactions have demonstrated the largest and most computationally powerful molecular circuits to date but are limited in biological systems due to the difficulty in genetically encoding components. Here, we develop scalable cotranscriptionally encoded RNA strand displacement (ctRSD) circuits that are rationally programmed via base pairing interactions. ctRSD circuits address the limitations of DNA-based strand displacement circuits by isothermally producing circuit components via transcription. We demonstrate circuit programmability in vitro by implementing logic and amplification elements, as well as multilayer cascades. Furthermore, we show that circuit kinetics are accurately predicted by a simple model of coupled transcription and strand displacement, enabling model-driven design. We envision ctRSD circuits will enable the rational design of powerful molecular circuits that operate in biological systems, including living cells.           ,              Self-assembling RNA circuits that execute programmable logic, amplification, and cascades are developed for synthetic biology.},

Despite their importance in cellular decision making, relatively little is known about cell-matrix interactions and the intracellular transduction of an initial ligand-receptor binding event on the single-molecule level. Here, we combine cRGD-ligand-decorated DNA tension sensors with DNA-PAINT super-resolution microscopy to study the mechanical engagement of single integrin receptors and the downstream influence on actin bundling. We uncover that integrin receptor clustering is governed by a non-random organization with complexes spaced at 20–30\,nm distances. The DNA-based tension sensor and analysis framework provide powerful tools to study a multitude of receptor-ligand interactions where forces are involved in ligand-receptor binding.},

  abstract = {Hitching a ride with a retroelement                            Retroviruses and retroelements have inserted their genetic code into mammalian genomes throughout evolution. Although many of these integrated virus-like sequences pose a threat to genomic integrity, some have been retooled by mammalian cells to perform essential roles in development. Segel               et al               . found that one of these retroviral-like proteins, PEG10, directly binds to and secretes its own mRNA in extracellular virus–like capsids. These virus-like particles were then pseudotyped with fusogens to deliver functional mRNA cargos to mammalian cells. This potentially provides an endogenous vector for RNA-based gene therapy. —DJ                        ,              The retrotransposon-derived Gag protein PEG10 can facilitate efficient and specific intercellular delivery of mRNAs in mammalian cells.           ,                             Eukaryotic genomes contain domesticated genes from integrating viruses and mobile genetic elements. Among these are homologs of the capsid protein (known as Gag) of long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons and retroviruses. We identified several mammalian Gag homologs that form virus-like particles and one LTR retrotransposon homolog, PEG10, that preferentially binds and facilitates vesicular secretion of its own messenger RNA (mRNA). We showed that the mRNA cargo of PEG10 can be reprogrammed by flanking genes of interest with               Peg10               ’s untranslated regions. Taking advantage of this reprogrammability, we developed selective endogenous encapsidation for cellular delivery (SEND) by engineering both mouse and human PEG10 to package, secrete, and deliver specific RNAs. Together, these results demonstrate that SEND is a modular platform suited for development as an efficient therapeutic delivery modality.},

  abstract = {As camera pixel arrays have grown larger and faster, and optical microscopy techniques ever more refined, there has been an explosion in the quantity of data acquired during routine light microcopy. At the single-molecule level, analysis involves multiple steps and can rapidly become computationally expensive, in some cases intractable on office workstations. Complex bespoke software can present high activation barriers to entry for new users. Here, we redevelop our quantitative single-molecule analysis routines into an optimized and extensible Python program, with GUI and command-line implementations to facilitate use on local machines and remote clusters, by beginners and advanced users alike. We demonstrate that its performance is on par with previous MATLAB implementations but runs an order of magnitude faster. We tested it against challenge data and demonstrate its performance is comparable to state-of-the-art analysis platforms. We show the code can extract fluorescence intensity values for single reporter dye molecules and, using these, estimate molecular stoichiometries and cellular copy numbers of fluorescently-labeled biomolecules. It can evaluate 2D diffusion coefficients for the characteristically short single-particle tracking data. To facilitate benchmarking we include data simulation routines to compare different analysis programs. Finally, we show that it works with 2-color data and enables colocalization analysis based on overlap integration, to infer interactions between differently labelled biomolecules. By making this freely available we aim to make complex light microscopy single-molecule analysis more democratized.},

Although there have been many studies on the application of functional particles to cells, the basic mechanism of penetration across a biological membrane is still poorly understood. Here we used a model membrane system to demonstrate that lateral membrane tension drives particle penetration across a lipid bilayer. After the application of osmotic pressure, fully wrapped particles on a liposome surface were found to enter the liposome. We discuss the mechanism of the tension-induced penetration in terms of narrow constriction of the membrane at the neck part. The present findings are expected to provide insight into the application of particles to biological systems.},

Differential expression profiles of miRNAs across a range of diseases have emerged as powerful biomarkers, making a reliable yet rapid profiling technique for miRNAs potentially essential in clinics. Here, we report an amplification-free multi-color single-molecule imaging technique that can profile purified endogenous miRNAs with high sensitivity, specificity, and reliability. Compared to previously reported techniques, our technique can discriminate single base mismatches and single-nucleotide 3′-tailing with low false positive rates regardless of their positions on miRNA. By preloading probes in               Thermus thermophilus               Argonaute (               Tt               Ago), miRNAs detection speed is accelerated by more than 20 times. Finally, by utilizing the well-conserved linearity between single-molecule spot numbers and the target miRNA concentrations, the absolute average copy numbers of endogenous miRNA species in a single cell can be estimated. Thus our technique, Ago-FISH (Argonaute-based Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization), provides a reliable way to accurately profile various endogenous miRNAs on a single miRNA sensing chip.},

  abstract = {DNA point accumulation for imaging in nanoscale topography (PAINT) is a rapidly developing fluorescence super-resolution technique, which allows for reaching spatial resolutions below 10 nm. It also enables the imaging of multiple targets in the same sample. However, using DNA-PAINT to observe cellular structures at such resolution remains challenging. Antibodies, which are commonly used for this purpose, lead to a displacement between the target protein and the reporting fluorophore of 20–25 nm, thus limiting the resolving power. Here, we used nanobodies to minimize this linkage error to \textasciitilde 4 nm. We demonstrate multiplexed imaging by using three nanobodies, each able to bind to a different family of fluorescent proteins. We couple the nanobodies with single DNA strands via a straight forward and stoichiometric chemical conjugation. Additionally, we built a versatile computer-controlled microfluidic setup to enable multiplexed DNA-PAINT in an efficient manner. As a proof of principle, we labeled and imaged proteins on mitochondria, the Golgi apparatus, and chromatin. We obtained super-resolved images of the three targets with 20 nm resolution, and within only 35 minutes acquisition time.},

Nevertheless, arrangement of chemical/biochemical components at the artificial device interfaces does not possess the same level of control. Here we report a tetrahedral DNA framework-enabled bulk enzyme heterojunction (BEH) strategy to program the multi-enzyme catalytic cascade at the interface of electrochemical biosensors. The construction of interpenetrating network of BEH at the millimeter-scale electrode interface brings enzyme pairs within the critical coupling length (CCL) of \textasciitilde 10\,nm, which in turn greatly improve the overall catalytic cascade efficiency by \textasciitilde 10-fold. We demonstrate the BEH generality with a range of enzyme pairs for electrochemically detecting clinically relevant molecular targets. As a proof~of~concept, a BEH-based sarcosine sensor enables single-step detection of the metabolic biomarker of sarcosine with ultrasensitivity, which hold the potential for precision diagnosis of early-stage prostate cancer.},

  abstract = {Tunneling nanotubes (TNTs) are thin membrane elongations among the cells that mediate the trafficking of subcellular organelles, biomolecules, and cues. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) receive substantial attention in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Many MSCs-based clinical trials are ongoing for dreadful diseases including cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. Mitochondrial trafficking through TNTs is one of the mechanisms used by MSCs to repair tissue damage and to promote tissue regeneration. Preclinical studies linked with ischemia, oxidative stress, mitochondrial damage, inflammation, and respiratory illness have demonstrated the therapeutic efficacy of MSCs via TNTs-mediated transfer of mitochondria and other molecules into the injured cells. On the other hand, MSCs-based cancer studies showed that TNTs may modulate chemoresistance in tumor cells as a result of mitochondrial trafficking. In the present review, we discuss the role of TNTs from preclinical studies associated with MSCs treatment. We discuss the impact of TNTs formation between MSCs and cancer cells and emphasize to study the importance of TNTs-mediated MSCs protection in disease models.},

However, photobleaching typically limits observation times to merely a few seconds, restricting downstream statistical analysis and observation of rare biological events. Here, we overcome this inherent limitation               via               continuous fluorophore exchange using DNA-PAINT, where fluorescently-labeled oligonucleotides reversibly bind to a single-stranded DNA handle attached to the target molecule. Such versatile and facile labeling allows uninterrupted monitoring of single molecules for extended durations. We demonstrate the power of our approach by observing DNA origami on membranes for tens of minutes, providing perspectives for investigating cellular processes on physiologically relevant timescales.},

Here, we report the bottom-up construction of a macromolecular transport system in which molecular pistons diffusively move through micrometer-long, hollow filaments. The pistons can cover micrometer distances in fractions of seconds. We build the system using multi-layer DNA origami and analyze the structures of the components using transmission electron microscopy. We study the motion of the pistons along the tubes using single-molecule fluorescence microscopy and perform Langevin simulations to reveal details of the free energy surface that directs the motions of the pistons. The tubular transport system achieves diffusivities and displacement ranges known from natural molecular motors and realizes mobility improvements over five orders of magnitude compared to previous artificial random walker designs. Electric fields can also be employed to actively pull the pistons along the filaments, thereby realizing a nanoscale electric rail system. Our system presents a platform for artificial motors that move autonomously driven by chemical fuels and for performing nanotribology studies, and it could form a basis for future molecular transportation networks.},

At the same time, they are exquisitely tuned to the mechanical environment and react to e.g. changes in cell and extracellular matrix stiffness or altered stretching due to reduced ejection fraction in heart disease, by adapting their cytoskeleton, force generation and cell mechanics. Both mechanical sensing and cell mechanical adaptations are multiscale processes. Receptor interactions with the extracellular matrix at the nanoscale will lead to clustering of receptors and modification of the cytoskeleton. This in turn alters mechanosensing, force generation, cell and nuclear stiffness and viscoelasticity at the microscale. Further, this affects cell shape, orientation, maturation and tissue integration at the microscale to macroscale. A variety of tools have been developed and adapted to measure cardiomyocyte receptor-ligand interactions and forces or mechanics at the different ranges, resulting in a wealth of new information about cardiomyocyte mechanobiology. Here, we take stock at the different tools for exploring cardiomyocyte mechanosensing and cell mechanics at the different scales from the nanoscale to microscale and macroscale.},

We investigated the effect of high pressure on the folding of duplex, DNA i-motif, and G-quadruplex (G4) structures; the non-canonical structures may be modulators of expression of genes involved in cancer progression. The i-motif structure was stabilized by high pressure, whereas the G4 structure was destabilized. The melting temperature of an intramolecular i-motif formed by 5′-dCGG(CCT)               10               CGG-3′ increased from 38.8 °C at atmospheric pressure to 61.5 °C at 400 MPa. This effect was also observed in the presence of 40 wt\% ethylene glycol, a crowding agent. In the presence of 40 wt\% ethylene glycol, the G4 structure was less destabilized than in the absence of the crowding agent.               P               –               T               stability diagrams of duplex DNA with a telomeric sequence indicated that the duplex is more stable than G4 and i-motif structures under low pressure, but the i-motif dominates the structural composition under high pressure. Under crowding conditions, the               P               –               T               diagrams indicated that the duplex does not form under high pressure, and i-motif and G4 structures dominate. Our findings imply that temperature regulates the formation of the duplex structure, whereas pressure triggers the formation of non-canonical DNA structures like i-motif and G4. These results suggest that pressure impacts the function of nucleic acids by stabilizing non-canonical structures; this may be relevant to deep sea organisms and during evolution under prebiotic conditions.},

  abstract = {DNA nanotechnology has provided new strategies and platforms for cargo delivery. However, DNA-based nanostructures utilized for cargo delivery have mainly focused on static structures and passive targeting. Here, inspired by honeybee's natural reaction to hazards, a melittin loaded tetrahedron framework nucleic acid (tFNA) nanostructure, for active targeting therapy as a "nanobee" is developed. Upon exposure to target proteins on the cell membrane, the tFNA exoskeleton goes through conformation change, leading to the selective release of melittin from the exoskeleton and the consequent selective lethal effect. As a result, the active targeting of the nanobee to tumor cells is achieved. At the same concentrations of melittin, the nanobee exhibits significantly higher and more selective cytotoxicity against target cells than free melittin molecules, whereas the inactive nanobee shows neglectable lethal effect. Notably, the complete encapsulation of melittin in the tFNA exoskeleton is confirmed by the combination of experimental screening and molecular dynamic analysis, which is proposed to be the origin of the minimized off-target effects of nanobee. This nanobee concept offers a strategy that may be extended to various dynamic stimuli-responsive cargo delivery systems, to enhance cargo stability and decrease severe off-target effects.},

  abstract = {The network of tunneling nanotubes (TNTs) represents the filamentous (F)-actin rich tubular structure which is connected to the cytoplasm of the adjacent and or distant cells to mediate efficient cell-to-cell communication. They are long cytoplasmic bridges with an extraordinary ability to perform diverse array of function ranging from maintaining cellular physiology and cell survival to promoting immune surveillance. Ironically, TNTs are now widely documented to promote the spread of various pathogens including viruses either during early or late phase of their lifecycle. In addition, TNTs have also been associated with multiple pathologies in a complex multicellular environment. While the recent work from multiple laboratories has elucidated the role of TNTs in cellular communication and maintenance of homeostasis, this review focuses on their exploitation by the diverse group of viruses such as retroviruses, herpesviruses, influenza A, human metapneumovirus and SARS CoV-2 to promote viral entry, virus trafficking and cell-to-cell spread. The later process may aggravate disease severity and the associated complications due to widespread dissemination of the viruses to multiple organ system as observed in current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. In addition, the TNT-mediated intracellular spread can be protective to the viruses from the circulating immune surveillance and possible neutralization activity present in the extracellular matrix. This review further highlights the relevance of TNTs in ocular and cardiac tissues including neurodegenerative diseases, chemotherapeutic resistance, and cancer pathogenesis. Taken together, we suggest that effective therapies should consider precise targeting of TNTs in several diseases including virus infections.},

However, to this day, this process requires cost-intensive optical instruments due to the truly nanoscopic signal of a single emitter. Simplifying single-molecule detection would enable many exciting applications, e.g., in point-of-care diagnostic settings, where costly equipment would be prohibitive. Here, we introduce addressable NanoAntennas with Cleared HOtSpots (NACHOS) that are scaffolded by DNA origami nanostructures and can be specifically tailored for the incorporation of bioassays. Single emitters placed in NACHOS emit up to 461-fold (average of 89\,±\,7-fold) brighter enabling their detection with a customary smartphone camera and an 8-US-dollar objective lens. To prove the applicability of our system, we built a portable, battery-powered smartphone microscope and successfully carried out an exemplary single-molecule detection assay for DNA specific to antibiotic-resistant               Klebsiella pneumonia               on the road.},

At the forefront of these developments is DNA-based point accumulation for~imaging in nanoscale topography (DNA-PAINT), which exploits the stochastic and transient binding of fluorescently labeled DNA probes. In its early stages the implementation of DNA-PAINT was burdened by low-throughput, excessive acquisition time, and difficult integration with live-cell imaging. However, recent advances are addressing these challenges and expanding the range of applications of DNA-PAINT. We review the current state of the art of DNA-PAINT in light of these advances and contemplate what further developments remain indispensable to realize live-cell imaging.},

  abstract = {Progression of pathology in neurodegenerative diseases is hypothesized to be a non–cell-autonomous process that may be mediated by the productive spreading of prion-like protein aggregates from a “donor cell” that is the source of misfolded aggregates to an “acceptor cell” in which misfolding is propagated by conversion of the normal protein. Although the proteins involved in the various diseases are unrelated, common pathways appear to be used for their intercellular propagation and spreading. Here, we summarize recent evidence of the molecular mechanisms relevant for the intercellular trafficking of protein aggregates involved in prion, Alzheimer’s, Huntington’s, and Parkinson’s diseases. We focus in particular on the common roles that lysosomes and tunneling nanotubes play in the formation and spreading of prion-like assemblies.},

  abstract = {Intercellular communications play a major role in tissue homeostasis and responses to external cues. Novel structures for this communication have recently been described. These tunneling nanotubes (TNTs) consist of thin-extended membrane protrusions that connect cells together. TNTs allow the cell-to-cell transfer of various cellular components, including proteins, RNAs, viruses, and organelles, such as mitochondria. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are both naturally present and recruited to many different tissues where their interaction with resident cells via secreted factors has been largely documented. Their immunosuppressive and repairing capacities constitute the basis for many current clinical trials. MSCs recruited to the tumor microenvironment also play an important role in tumor progression and resistance to therapy. MSCs are now the focus of intense scrutiny due to their capacity to form TNTs and transfer mitochondria to target cells, either in normal physiological or in pathological conditions, leading to changes in cell energy metabolism and functions, as described in this review.},

  abstract = {We develop a detailed description of protein translational and rotational diffusion in concentrated solution on the basis of all-atom molecular dynamics simulations in explicit solvent. Our systems contain up to 540 fully flexible proteins with 3.6 million atoms. In concentrated protein solutions (100 mg/mL and higher), the proteins ubiquitin and lysozyme, as well as the protein domains third IgG-binding domain of protein G and villin headpiece, diffuse not as isolated particles, but as members of transient clusters between which they constantly exchange. A dynamic cluster model nearly quantitatively explains the increase in viscosity and the decrease in protein diffusivity with protein volume fraction, which both exceed the predictions from widely used colloid models. The Stokes–Einstein relations for translational and rotational diffusion remain valid, but the effective hydrodynamic radius grows linearly with protein volume fraction. This increase follows the observed increase in cluster size and explains the more dramatic slowdown of protein rotation compared with translation. Baxter’s sticky-sphere model of colloidal suspensions captures the concentration dependence of cluster size, viscosity, and rotational and translational diffusion. The consistency between simulations and experiments for a diverse set of soluble globular proteins indicates that the cluster model applies broadly to concentrated protein solutions, with equilibrium dissociation constants for nonspecific protein–protein binding in the K               d               ≈ 10-mM regime.},

Despite the enthusiasm and innovations fuelled by DL technology, the need to access powerful and compatible resources to train DL networks leads to an accessibility barrier that novice users often find difficult to overcome. Here, we present ZeroCostDL4Mic, an entry-level platform simplifying DL access by leveraging the free, cloud-based computational resources of Google Colab. ZeroCostDL4Mic allows researchers with no coding expertise to train and apply key DL networks to perform tasks including segmentation (using U-Net and StarDist), object detection (using YOLOv2), denoising (using CARE and Noise2Void), super-resolution microscopy (using Deep-STORM), and image-to-image translation (using Label-free prediction - fnet, pix2pix and CycleGAN). Importantly, we provide suitable quantitative tools for each network to evaluate model performance, allowing model optimisation. We demonstrate the application of the platform to study multiple biological processes.},

Traction force microscopy (TFM) has been instrumental for studying such forces, providing spatial force measurements at subcellular resolution. However, the applications of classical TFM are restricted by the typical planar geometry. Here, we develop a particle-based force sensing strategy for studying cellular interactions. We establish a straightforward batch approach for synthesizing uniform, deformable and tuneable hydrogel particles, which can also be easily derivatized. The 3D shape of such particles can be resolved with superresolution ({$<$}50\,nm) accuracy using conventional confocal microscopy. We introduce a reference-free computational method allowing inference of traction forces with high sensitivity directly from the particle shape. We illustrate the potential of this approach by revealing subcellular force patterns throughout phagocytic engulfment and force dynamics in the cytotoxic T-cell immunological synapse. This strategy can readily be adapted for studying cellular forces in a wide range of applications.},

Conventional DNA catabolic strategies are restrained with the fragile and unclear enzymatic reactions that might lead to inefficient and uncontrollable digestion of DNA scaffolds and thus might bring undesirable side effects to the sophisticated biosystems. Herein we reported a versatile self-sufficient DNAzyme-driven drug delivery system consisting of the rolling circle polymerized DNAzyme-substrate scaffolds and the encapsulated pH-responsive ZnO nanoparticles (NPs). The full DNAzyme nanosponges (NSs) were also encoded with multivalent tandem aptamer sequences to facilitate their efficient delivery into cancer cells, where the acidic endo/lysosomal microenvironment stimulates the dissolution of ZnO into Zn2+ ions as DNAzyme cofactors and therapeutic reactive oxygen species generators. The supplement Zn2+ cofactors mediated the nonviolent DNAzyme-catalyzed cleavage of DNA scaffolds for precise and efficient drug administrations with synergistically enhanced therapeutic performance. The facile design of DNAzyme, together with their cost-effective and intrinsic robust features, is anticipated to provide extensive insights for the development of DNA-based therapeutic platforms by activating the specific intracellular biocatalytic reactions. As an intelligent and nonviolent self-driven drug delivery platform, the present DNAzyme NS system could be engineered with more therapeutic sequences and agents and was anticipated to show exceptional promise and versatility for applications in biomedicine and bioengineering.},

  abstract = {Using the DNA origami technique, we constructed a DNA nanodevice functionalized with small interfering RNA (siRNA) within its inner cavity and the chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin (DOX), intercalated in the DNA duplexes. The incorporation of disulfide bonds allows the triggered mechanical opening and release of siRNA in response to intracellular glutathione (GSH) in tumors to knockdown genes key to cancer progression. Combining RNA interference and chemotherapy, the nanodevice induced potent cytotoxicity and tumor growth inhibition, without observable systematic toxicity. Given its autonomous behavior, exceptional designability, potent antitumor activity and marked biocompatibility, this DNA nanodevice represents a promising strategy for precise drug design for cancer therapy.},

  abstract = {A nanomotor is a miniaturized device that converts energy stored in the environment into mechanical motion. The last two decades have witnessed a surge of research interests in the biomedical applications of nanomotors, but little clinical translation. To accelerate this process, targeted cancer therapy is used as an example to describe a "survive, locate, operate, and terminate" (SLOT) mission of a nanomotor, where it must 1) survive in the unfriendly in vivo environment, 2) locate its target as well as be located by human operators, 3) carry out specific operations, and 4) terminate after the mission is completed. Along this journey, the challenges presented to a nanomotor, including to power, navigate, steer, target, release, control, image, and communicate are discussed, and how state-of-the-art nanomotors meet or fall short of these requirements is critically reviewed. These discussions are then condensed into a table for easy reference. In particular, it is argued that chemically powered nanomotors are intrinsically ill-positioned for targeted cancer therapy, while nanomotors powered by magnetic fields or ultrasound show more promises. Following this argument, a tentative nanomotor design is then presented in the end to conform to the SLOT guideline, and to inspire practical, functional nanorobots that are yet to come.},

  abstract = {In recent years, DNA has been widely noted as a kind of material that can be used to construct building blocks for biosensing, in vivo imaging, drug development, and disease therapy because of its advantages of good biocompatibility and programmable properties. However, traditional DNA-based sensing processes are mostly achieved by random diffusion of free DNA probes, which were restricted by limited dynamics and relatively low efficiency. Moreover, in the application of biosystems, single-stranded DNA probes face challenges such as being difficult to internalize into cells and being easily decomposed in the cellular microenvironment. To overcome the above limitations, DNA nanostructure-based probes have attracted intense attention. This kind of probe showed a series of advantages compared to the conventional ones, including increased biostability, enhanced cell internalization efficiency, accelerated reaction rate, and amplified signal output, and thus improved in vitro and in vivo applications. Therefore, reviewing and summarizing the important roles of DNA nanostructures in improving biosensor design is very necessary for the development of DNA nanotechnology and its applications in biology and pharmacology. In this perspective, DNA nanostructure-based probes are reviewed and summarized from several aspects: probe classification according to the dimensions of DNA nanostructures (one, two, and three-dimensional nanostructures), the common connection modes between nucleic acid probes and DNA nanostructures, and the most important advantages of DNA self-assembled nanostructures in the applications of biosensing, imaging analysis, cell assembly, cell capture, and theranostics. Finally, the challenges and prospects for the future development of DNA nanostructure-based nucleic acid probes are also discussed.},

However, currently the design and optimization of custom 3D DNA-origami shapes is a barrier to rapid application to new areas. Here we introduce a modular barrel architecture, and demonstrate hierarchical assembly of a 100 megadalton DNA-origami barrel of \textasciitilde 90\,nm diameter and \textasciitilde 250\,nm height, that provides a rhombic-lattice canvas of a thousand pixels each, with pitch of \textasciitilde 8\,nm, on its inner and outer surfaces. Complex patterns rendered on these surfaces were resolved using up to twelve rounds of Exchange-PAINT super-resolution microscopy. We envision these structures as versatile nanoscale pegboards for applications requiring complex 3D arrangements of matter, which will serve to promote rapid uptake of this technology in diverse fields beyond specialist groups working in DNA nanotechnology.},

  abstract = {Abstract             i-Motifs are widely used in nanotechnology, play a part in gene regulation and have been detected in human nuclei. As these structures are composed of cytosine, they are potential sites for epigenetic modification. In addition to 5-methyl- and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine modifications, recent evidence has suggested biological roles for 5-formylcytosine and 5-carboxylcytosine. Herein the human telomeric i-motif sequence was used to examine how these four epigenetic modifications alter the thermal and pH stability of i-motifs. Changes in melting temperature and transitional pH depended on both the type of modification and its position within the i-motif forming sequence. The cytosines most sensitive to modification were next to the first and third loops within the structure. Using previously described i-motif forming sequences, we screened the MCF-7 and MCF-10A methylomes to map 5-methylcytosine and found the majority of sequences were differentially methylated in MCF7 (cancerous) and MCF10A (non-cancerous) cell lines. Furthermore, i-motif forming sequences stable at neutral pH were significantly more likely to be epigenetically modified than traditional acidic i-motif forming sequences. This work has implications not only in the epigenetic regulation of DNA, but also allows discreet tunability of i-motif stability for nanotechnological applications.},

  abstract = {Focused Ion Beam Scanning Electron Microscopy (FIB-SEM) can automatically generate 3D images with superior z-axis resolution, yielding data that needs minimal image registration and related post-processing. Obstacles blocking wider adoption of FIB-SEM include slow imaging speed and lack of long-term system stability, which caps the maximum possible acquisition volume. Here, we present techniques that accelerate image acquisition while greatly improving FIB-SEM reliability, allowing the system to operate for months and generating continuously imaged volumes {$>$} 106 µm3. These volumes are large enough for connectomics, where the excellent z resolution can help in tracing of small neuronal processes and accelerate the tedious and time-consuming human proofreading effort. Even higher resolution can be achieved on smaller volumes. We present example data sets from mammalian neural tissue, Drosophila brain, and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii to illustrate the power of this novel high-resolution technique to address questions in both connectomics and cell biology.           ,              Precise three-dimensional imaging can help make sense of microscopic details in biology. These images are usually built up from many two-dimensional images stacked on top of each other. One approach for examining particularly fine details, such as the connections between nerve cells in the brain, is called focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy (or FIB-SEM for short). This approach works by creating an image of the surface layer of a sample, which is then stripped away using a beam of charged particles to reveal the layer beneath. The new surface can then be imaged and so on, through the whole sample.             Unfortunately, FIB-SEM devices are currently slow and can only run for a short time, leading to a lack of continuity in the stack of images. FIB-SEM would allow faster, more accurate and detailed studies of connections between brain cells, and other elaborate biological systems, if the technology could be made faster and more reliable over months of continuous operation. The current technical challenge is to create a system that can, for example, successfully image and analyse all the connections between the more than 100 thousand cells that make up the brain of a fruit fly – a common model organism in neurobiology.             Xu et al. aimed to create a technique to image a complete fly brain, with gaps of just 8 nanometres between each image in a stack, within a reasonable timeframe. By improving how FIB-SEM signals are detected, making use of advances in ion beam controls, and by engineering ways to recover from system malfunctions, Xu et al. developed an enhanced FIB-SEM device. To demonstrate its value, the new technology was used to create images of a third of a fruit fly’s brain, parts of a mouse’s brain, and cells of a single-celled alga called Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.             The results show that large and complex samples can be successfully imaged in their entirety to adequate detail, enabling high-quality reconstruction of the connections between nerve cells. The level of detail, which can be further increased for smaller samples, offers advantages in precision and image quality over other comparable techniques. As well as helping to study the brain, this approach could also be used to examine details inside cells. Future work to advance this technology will enable larger and more complete imaging of elaborate biological structures.},

Protrusion-based cellular interactions allow for specific communication between participating cells and have a distinct spectrum of advantages compared to secretion- and diffusion-based intercellular communication. Identification of protrusion-based signaling in diverse systems suggests that this mechanism is a ubiquitous and prevailing means of communication employed by many cell types. Moreover, accumulating evidence indicates that protrusion-based intercellular communication is often involved in pathogenesis, including cancers and infections. Here we review our current understanding of protrusion-based intercellular communication.},

  abstract = {DNA or its analogues with an environment-sensitive fluorescent label are potentially useful as a probe for studying the structure and dynamics of nucleic acids. In this work, pyrrolidinyl peptide nucleic acid (acpcPNA) was labeled at its backbone with Nile red, a solvatochromic benzophenoxazine dye, by means of click chemistry. The optical properties of the Nile red-labeled acpcPNA were investigated by UV–vis and fluorescence spectroscopy in the absence and in the presence of DNA. In contrast to the usual quenching observed in Nile red-labeled DNA, the hybridization with DNA resulted in blue shifting and an enhanced fluorescence regardless of the neighboring bases. More pronounced blue shifts and fluorescence enhancements were observed when the DNA target carried a base insertion in close proximity to the Nile red label. The results indicate that the Nile red label is located in a more hydrophobic environment in acpcPNA–DNA duplexes than in the single-stranded acpcPNA. The different fluorescence properties of the acpcPNA hybrids of complementary DNA and DNA carrying a base insertion are suggestive of different interactions between the Nile red label and the duplexes.},

The latter consists of a collection of spatial coordinates and their associated uncertainties. We describe iterative parameter-estimation algorithms based on this framework, as well as a sampling algorithm to numerically evaluate the complete posterior distribution. We demonstrate that the inverse computation can be viewed as a type of image restoration process similar to the classical image deconvolution methods, except that it is performed on SMLM images. We further discuss an application of our statistical framework in the task of particle fusion using SMLM data. We show that the fusion algorithm based on our model outperforms the current state-of-the-art in terms of both accuracy and computational cost.},

Current research focuses on their application in cell or animal models, while their use in plants is limited because their ecotoxicological impact is poorly documented. Here, we examine the toxicity and fate of AuNPs in plants using oilseed rape as a model. We show that AuNPs will not affect the germination of rape seeds as well as the growth of the plantlet. Significantly, we demonstrate the effective translocation of AuNPs in plant tissues, and AuNPs will not interfere with the natural distribution of mineral nutrient elements in plant tissues. Our results demonstrate the mild effect of AuNPs on the growth of oilseed rape seedlings and suggest their potential application as vehicles for gene delivery in plants.},

However, constructing protocols based on biomolecular reactions to guarantee confidentiality, integrity and availability (CIA) of information remains a challenge. Here we develop DNA origami cryptography (DOC) that exploits folding of a M13 viral scaffold into nanometer-scale self-assembled braille-like patterns for secure communication, which can create a key with a size of over 700 bits. The intrinsic nanoscale addressability of DNA origami additionally allows for protein binding-based steganography, which further protects message confidentiality in DOC. The integrity of a transmitted message can be ensured by establishing specific linkages between several DNA origamis carrying parts of the message. The versatility of DOC is further demonstrated by transmitting various data formats including text, musical notes and images, supporting its great potential for meeting the rapidly increasing CIA demands of next-generation cryptography.},
