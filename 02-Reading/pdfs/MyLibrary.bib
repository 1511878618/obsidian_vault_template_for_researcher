  abstract = {We report the development of multiplexed cellular super-resolution imaging using DNA-barcoded binders.           ,                             Recent advances in super-resolution fluorescence imaging allow researchers to overcome the classical diffraction limit of light, and are already starting to make an impact in biology. However, a key challenge for traditional super-resolution methods is their limited multiplexing capability, which prevents a systematic understanding of multi-protein interactions on the nanoscale. Exchange-PAINT, a recently developed DNA-based multiplexing approach, in theory facilitates spectrally-unlimited multiplexing by sequentially imaging target molecules using orthogonal dye-labeled ‘imager’ strands. While this approach holds great promise for the bioimaging community, its widespread application has been hampered by the availability of DNA-conjugated ligands for protein labeling. Herein, we report a universal approach for the creation of DNA-barcoded labeling probes for highly multiplexed Exchange-PAINT imaging, using a variety of affinity reagents such as primary and secondary antibodies, nanobodies, and small molecule binders. Furthermore, we extend the availability of orthogonal imager strands for Exchange-PAINT to over 50 and assay their orthogonality in a novel DNA origami-based crosstalk assay. Using our optimized conjugation and labeling strategies, we demonstrate nine-color super-resolution imaging               in situ               in fixed cells.},

  abstract = {Nanoparticle deposition in microchannel devices inducing contaminant clogging is a serious barrier to the application of micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS). For micro-scale gas flow fields with a high Knudsen number (Kn) in the microchannel, gas rarefaction and velocity slip cannot be ignored. Furthermore, the mechanism of nanoparticle transport and deposition in the microchannel is extremely complex. In this study, the compressible gas model and a second-order slip boundary condition have been applied to the Burnett equations to solve the flow field issue in a microchannel. Drag, Brownian, and thermophoretic forces are concerned in the motion equations of particles. A series of numerical simulations for various particle sizes, flow rates, and temperature gradients have been performed. Some important features such as reasons, efficiencies, and locations of particle deposition have been explored. The results indicate that the particle deposition efficiency varies more or less under the actions of forces such as Brownian force, thermophoretic force, and drag force. Nevertheless, different forces lead to different particle motions and deposition processes. Brownian or thermophoretic force causes particles to move closer to the wall or further away from it. The drag force influence of slip boundary conditions and gas rarefaction changes the particles’ residential time in the channel. In order to find a way to decrease particle deposition on the microchannel surface, the deposition locations of different sizes of particles have been analyzed in detail under the action of thermophoretic force.},

Therefore, a resistance-free antibacterial therapy is necessary to overcome MDR MRSA infections. In this study, an antibacterial nanorobot (Ab-nanobot) is developed wherein a cell wall-binding domain (CBD)-endolysin, acting as a sensor, is covalently conjugated with an actuator consisting of an iron oxide/silica core-shell. The CBD-endolysin sensor shows an excellent specificity to detect, bind, and accumulate on the S. aureus USA300 cell surface even in a bacterial consortium, and in host cell infections. Ab-nanobot specifically captures and kills MRSA in response to medically approved radiofrequency (RF) electromagnetic stimulation (EMS) signal. When Ab-nanobot receives the RF-EMS signal on the cell surface, actuator induces cell death in MRSA with 99.999\% removal within 20 min by cell-wall damage via generation of localized heat and reactive oxygen species. The in vivo efficacy of Ab-nanobot is proven using a mice subcutaneous skin infection model. Collectively, this study offers a nanomedical resistance-free strategy to overcome MDR MRSA infections by providing a highly specific nanorobot for S. aureus.},

With DNA-based PAINT (DNA-PAINT), resolutions down to a few nanometers have been reached on DNA-origami nanostructures. However, for long acquisition times, we find a photo-induced depletion of binding sites in DNA-PAINT microscopy that ultimately limits the quality of the rendered images. Here we systematically investigate the loss of binding sites in DNA-PAINT imaging and support the observations with measurements of DNA hybridization kinetics via surface-integrated fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (SI-FCS). We do not only show that the depletion of binding sites is clearly photo-induced, but also provide evidence that it is mainly caused by dye-induced generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). We evaluate two possible strategies to reduce the depletion of binding sites: By addition of oxygen scavenging reagents, and by the positioning of the fluorescent dye at a larger distance from the binding site.},

  abstract = {Influenza vaccines that confer broad and durable protection against diverse viral strains would have a major effect on global health, as they would lessen the need for annual vaccine reformulation and immunization(1). Here we show that computationally designed, two-component nanoparticle immunogens(2) induce potently neutralizing and broadly protective antibody responses against a wide variety of influenza viruses. The nanoparticle immunogens contain 20 haemagglutinin glycoprotein trimers in an ordered array, and their assembly in vitro enables the precisely controlled co-display of multiple distinct haemagglutinin proteins in defined ratios. Nanoparticle immunogens that co-display the four haemagglutinins of licensed quadrivalent influenza vaccines elicited antibody responses in several animal models against vaccine-matched strains that were equivalent to or better than commercial quadrivalent influenza vaccines, and simultaneously induced broadly protective antibody responses to heterologous viruses by targeting the subdominant yet conserved haemagglutinin stem. The combination of potent receptor-blocking and cross-reactive stem-directed antibodies induced by the nanoparticle immunogens makes them attractive candidates for a supraseasonal influenza vaccine candidate with the potential to replace conventional seasonal vaccines(3).},

  abstract = {Abstract             Single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) has allowed the observation of various molecular structures in cells beyond the diffraction limit using organic dyes. In principle, the SMLM resolution depends on the precision of photoswitching fluorophore localization, which is inversely correlated with the square root of the number of photons released from the individual fluorophores. Thus, increasing the photon number by using highly bright fluorophores, such as quantum dots (QDs), can theoretically fundamentally overcome the current resolution limit of SMLM. However, the use of QDs in SMLM has been challenging because QDs have no photoswitching property, which is essential for SMLM, and they exhibit nonspecificity and multivalency, which complicate their use in fluorescence imaging. Here, we present a method to utilize QDs in SMLM to surpass the resolution limit of the current SMLM utilizing organic dyes. We confer monovalency, specificity, and photoswitchability on QDs by steric exclusion via passivation and ligand exchange with ptDNA, PEG, and casein as well as by DNA point accumulation for imaging in nanoscale topography (DNA-PAINT) via automatic thermally driven hybridization between target-bound docking and dye-bound complementary imager strands. QDs are made monovalent and photoswitchable to enable SMLM and show substantially better photophysical properties than Cy3, with higher fluorescence intensity and an improved resolution factor. QD-PAINT displays improved spatial resolution with a narrower full width at half maximum (FWHM) than DNA-PAINT with Cy3. In summary, QD-PAINT shows great promise as a next-generation SMLM method for overcoming the limited resolution of the current SMLM.},

  abstract = {Abstract             DNA points accumulation for imaging in nanoscale topography (DNA-PAINT) facilitates multiplexing in superresolution microscopy but is practically limited by slow imaging speed. To address this issue, we propose the additions of ethylene carbonate (EC) to the imaging buffer, sequence repeats to the docking strand, and a spacer between the docking strand and the affinity agent. Collectively termed DNA-PAINT-ERS (E\,=\,EC, R\,=\,Repeating sequence, and S\,=\,Spacer), these strategies can be easily integrated into current DNA-PAINT workflows for both accelerated imaging speed and improved image quality through optimized DNA hybridization kinetics and efficiency. We demonstrate the general applicability of DNA-PAINT-ERS for fast, multiplexed superresolution imaging using previously validated oligonucleotide constructs with slight modifications.},

Its performance in biological samples is often constrained by strong background signals and non-specific binding events, both exacerbated by high imager concentrations. Here we describe Repeat DNA-PAINT, a method that enables a substantial reduction in imager concentration, thus suppressing spurious signals. Additionally, Repeat DNA-PAINT reduces photoinduced target-site loss and can accelerate sampling, all without affecting spatial resolution.},

It was recently shown that infrared light excitation of intramolecular vibrations can radically change the efficiency of electron transfer, a fundamental chemical process. We now extend and generalize the understanding of this phenomenon by probing and perturbing vibronic coupling in several molecules in solution. In the experiments an ultrafast electronic-vibrational pulse sequence is applied to a range of donor-bridge-acceptor Pt(II) trans-acetylide assemblies, for which infrared excitation of selected bridge vibrations during ultraviolet-initiated charge separation alters the yields of light-induced product states. The experiments, augmented by quantum chemical calculations, reveal a complex combination of vibronic mechanisms responsible for the observed changes in electron transfer rates and pathways. The study raises new fundamental questions about the function of vibrational processes immediately following charge transfer photoexcitation, and highlights the molecular features necessary for external vibronic control of excited-state processes.},

One of the universal features of living systems is cell growth, where the cell membrane expands through the incorporation of newly synthesized lipid molecules. Here, the gradual tension-mediated growth of cell-sized (≈10 µm) giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) is demonstrated, to which nanometer-sized (≈30 nm) small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) are provided, that act as a lipid source. By putting tension on the GUV membranes through a transmembrane osmotic pressure, SUV-GUV fusion events are promoted and substantial growth of the GUV is caused, even up to doubling its volume. Thus, experimental evidence is provided that membrane tension alone is sufficient to bring about membrane fusion and growth is demonstrated for both pure phospholipid liposomes and for hybrid vesicles with a mixture of phospholipids and fatty acids. The results show that growth of liposomes can be realized in a protein-free minimal system, which may find useful applications in achieving autonomous synthetic cells that are capable of undergoing a continuous growth-division cycle.},

Here, we report a DNA nanodevice that can achieve tumor recognition and treatment with improved spatiotemporal precision under the regulation of orthogonal near-infrared (NIR) light. The nanodevice is built by combining an ultraviolet (UV) light-activatable aptamer module and a photosensitizer (PS) with up-conversion nanoparticle (UCNP) that enables the operation of the nanodevice with deep tissue-penetrable NIR light. The UCNPs can convert two distinct NIR excitations into orthogonal UV and green emissions for programmable photoactivation of the aptamer modules and PSs, respectively, allowing spatiotemporally controlled target recognition and photodynamic antitumor effect. Furthermore, when combined with immune checkpoint blockade therapy, the nanodevice results in regression of untreated distant tumors.

Previous studies have used artificially synthesized DNA to store data and automated next-generation sequencing to read it back. Here, we report digital Nucleic Acid Memory (dNAM) for applications that require a limited amount of data to have high information density, redundancy, and copy number. In dNAM, data is encoded by selecting combinations of single-stranded DNA with (1) or without (0) docking-site domains. When self-assembled with scaffold DNA, staple strands form DNA origami breadboards. Information encoded into the breadboards is read by monitoring the binding of fluorescent imager probes using DNA-PAINT super-resolution microscopy. To enhance data retention, a multi-layer error correction scheme that combines fountain and bi-level parity codes is used. As a prototype, fifteen origami encoded with ‘Data is in our DNA!\textbackslash n’ are analyzed. Each origami encodes unique data-droplet, index, orientation, and error-correction information. The error-correction algorithms fully recover the message when individual docking sites, or entire origami, are missing. Unlike other approaches to DNA-based data storage, reading dNAM does not require sequencing. As such, it offers an additional path to explore the advantages and disadvantages of DNA as an emerging memory material.},

Single molecule FRET (sm-FRET) measurements on immobilized molecules permit long observations of the system -effectively until both dyes photobleach- resulting in time-traces that report on biomolecular dynamics with a broad range of timescales from milliseconds to minutes. To facilitate the acquisition of large number of traces for statistical analyses, the process must be automated and the sample environment should be tightly controlled over the entire measurement time (approximately 12 hours). This is accomplished using an automated scanning confocal microscope that allows the interrogation of thousands of single molecules overnight, and a microfluidic cell that permits the controlled exchange of buffer, with restricted oxygen content and maintains a constant temperature throughout the entire measuring period. Here we show how to assemble the microfluidic device and how to activate its surface for DNA immobilization. Then we explain how to prepare a buffer to maximize the photostability and lifetime of the fluorophores. Finally, we show the steps involved in preparing the setup for the automated acquisition of time-resolved single molecule FRET traces of DNA molecules.},

  abstract = {We consider here the effect of Fermi resonance on the rate of stochastic transitions over potential barriers. As a typical phenomenon for Fermi resonance we investigate the fading of the energy between the oscillations in different degrees of freedom. Due to this fading phenomenon we see from time to time rather large amplitudes of oscillations along the reaction path which may support transitions over reaction barriers in the underdamped regime. As as an application we study the influence of Fermi resonance on enzyme reactions. In particular we investigate the possible effect of Fermi resonance on the breaking of peptide bonds.},

  abstract = {Effective drug delivery systems that can systematically and selectively transport payloads to disease cells remain a challenge. Here, a targeting ligand-modified DNA origami nanostructure (DON) as an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC)-like carrier for targeted prostate cancer therapy is reported. Specifically, DON of six helical bundles is modified with a ligand 2-[3-(1,3-dicarboxy propyl)-ureido] pentanedioic acid (DUPA) against prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), to serve as the antibody for drug conjugation in ADC. Doxorubicin (Dox) is then loaded to DON through intercalation to dsDNA. This platform features in spatially controllable organization of targeting ligands and high drug loading capacity. With this nanocomposite, selective delivery of Dox to the PSMA+ cancer cell line LNCaP is readily achieved. The consequent therapeutic efficacy is critically dependent on the numbers of targeting ligand assembled on DON. This target-specific and biocompatible drug delivery platform with high maximum tolerated doses shows immense potential for developing novel nanomedicine.},

  abstract = {Recent advancements in single-molecule-based superresolution microscopy have made it possible to visualize biological structures with unprecedented spatial resolution. Determining the spatial coorganization of these structures within cells under physiological and pathological conditions is an important biological goal. This goal has been stymied by the current limitations of carrying out superresolution microscopy in multiple colors. Here, we develop an approach for simultaneous multicolor superresolution imaging which relies solely on fluorophore excitation, rather than fluorescence emission properties. By modulating the intensity of the excitation lasers at different frequencies, we show that the color channel can be determined based on the fluorophore’s response to the modulated excitation. We use this frequency multiplexing to reduce the image acquisition time of multicolor superresolution DNA-PAINT while maintaining all its advantages: minimal color cross-talk, minimal photobleaching, maximal signal throughput, ability to maintain the fluorophore density per imaged color, and ability to use the full camera field of view. We refer to this imaging modality as “frequency multiplexed DNA-PAINT,” or fm-DNA-PAINT for short. We also show that frequency multiplexing is fully compatible with STORM superresolution imaging, which we term fm-STORM. Unlike fm-DNA-PAINT, fm-STORM is prone to color cross-talk. To overcome this caveat, we further develop a machine-learning algorithm to correct for color cross-talk with more than 95\% accuracy, without the need for prior information about the imaged structure.},

  abstract = {Piezo1 is an ion channel that gates open when mechanical force is applied to a cell membrane, thus allowing cells to detect and respond to mechanical stimulation. Molecular structures of Piezo1 reveal a large ion channel with an unusually curved shape. This study analyzes how such a curved ion channel interacts energetically with the cell membrane. Through membrane mechanical calculations, we show that Piezo1 deforms the membrane shape outside the perimeter of the channel into a curved ‘membrane footprint’. This membrane footprint amplifies the sensitivity of Piezo1 to changes in membrane tension, rendering it exquisitely responsive. We assert that the shape of the Piezo channel is an elegant example of molecular form evolved to optimize a specific function, in this case tension sensitivity. Furthermore, the predicted influence of the membrane footprint on Piezo gating is consistent with the demonstrated importance of membrane-cytoskeletal attachments to Piezo gating.},

  abstract = {Protocols in the academic life science laboratory are heavily reliant on the manual manipulation of tools, reagents and instruments by a host of research staff and students. In contrast to industrial and clinical laboratory environments, the usage of automation to augment or replace manual tasks is limited. Causes of this 'automation gap' are unique to academic research, with rigid short-term funding structures, high levels of protocol variability and a benevolent culture of investment in people over equipment. Automation, however, can bestow multiple benefits through improvements in reproducibility, researcher efficiency, clinical translation, and safety. Less immediately obvious are the accompanying limitations, including obsolescence and an inhibitory effect on the freedom to innovate. Growing the range of automation options suitable for research laboratories will require more flexible, modular and cheaper designs. Academic and commercial developers of automation will increasingly need to design with an environmental awareness and an understanding that large high-tech robotic solutions may not be appropriate for laboratories with constrained financial and spatial resources. To fully exploit the potential of laboratory automation, future generations of scientists will require both engineering and biology skills. Automation in the research laboratory is likely to be an increasingly critical component of future research programs and will continue the trend of combining engineering and science expertise together to answer novel research questions.},

  abstract = {Single molecule fluorescence spectroscopy has been largely implemented using methods which require tethering of molecules to a substrate in order to make high temporal resolution measurements. However, the act of tethering a molecule requires that the molecule be removed from its environment. This is especially perturbative when measuring biomolecules such as enzymes, which may rely on the non-equilibrium and crowded cellular environment for normal function. A method which may be able to un-tether single molecule fluorescence spectroscopy is real-time 3D single particle tracking (RT-3D-SPT). RT-3D-SPT uses active feedback to effectively lock-on to freely diffusing particles so they can be measured continuously with up to photon-limited temporal resolution over large axial ranges. This review gives an overview of the various active feedback 3D single particle tracking methods, highlighting specialized detection and excitation schemes which enable high-speed real-time tracking. Furthermore, the combination of these active feedback methods with simultaneous live-cell imaging is discussed. Finally, the successes in real-time 3D single molecule tracking (RT-3D-SMT) thus far and the roadmap going forward for this promising family of techniques are discussed.},

Here, we present a 3D single-molecule active real-time tracking method (3D-SMART) which is capable of locking on to single fluorophores in solution for minutes at a time with photon limited temporal resolution. As a demonstration, 3D-SMART is applied to actively track single Atto 647\,N fluorophores in 90\% glycerol solution with an average duration of \textasciitilde 16\,s at count rates of \textasciitilde 10\,kHz. Active feedback tracking is further applied to single proteins and nucleic acids, directly measuring the diffusion of various lengths (99 to 1385\,bp) of single DNA molecules at rates up to 10\,µm               2               /s. In addition, 3D-SMART is able to quantify the occupancy of single Spinach2 RNA aptamers and capture active transcription on single freely diffusing DNA. 3D-SMART represents a critical step towards the untethering of single molecule spectroscopy.},

  abstract = {Micro/nanorobot, as a research field, has attracted interest in recent years. It has great potential in medical treatment, as it can be applied in targeted drug delivery, surgical operation, disease diagnosis, etc. Differently from traditional drug delivery, which relies on blood circulation to reach the target, the designed micro/nanorobots can move autonomously, which makes it possible to deliver drugs to the hard-to-reach areas. Micro/nanorobots were driven by exogenous power (magnetic fields, light energy, acoustic fields, electric fields, etc.) or endogenous power (chemical reaction energy). Cell-based micro/nanorobots and DNA origami without autonomous movement ability were also introduced in this article. Although micro/nanorobots have excellent prospects, the current research is mainly based on in vitro experiments; in vivo research is still in its infancy. Further biological experiments are required to verify in vivo drug delivery effects of micro/nanorobots. This paper mainly discusses the research status, challenges, and future development of micro/nanorobots.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Small RNAs are non-coding RNAs that play important roles in the lives of both animals and plants. They are 21- to 24-nt in length and ∼10 nm in size. Their small size and high diversity have made it challenging to develop detection methods that have sufficient resolution and specificity to multiplex and quantify. We created a method, sRNA-PAINT, for the detection of small RNAs with 20 nm resolution by combining the super-resolution method, DNA-based points accumulation in nanoscale topography (DNA-PAINT), and the specificity of locked nucleic acid (LNA) probes for the in situ detection of multiple small RNAs. The method relies on designing probes to target small RNAs that combine DNA oligonucleotides (oligos) for PAINT with LNA-containing oligos for hybridization; therefore, we developed an online tool called ‘Vetting \& Analysis of RNA for in situ Hybridization probes’ (VARNISH) for probe design. Our method utilizes advances in DNA-PAINT methodologies, including qPAINT for quantification, and Exchange-PAINT for multiplexing. We demonstrated these capabilities of sRNA-PAINT by detecting and quantifying small RNAs in different cell layers of early developmental stage maize anthers that are important for male sexual reproduction.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Mechanosensitive Piezo1 channels are essential mechanotransduction proteins in eukaryotes. Their curved transmembrane domains, called arms, create a convex membrane deformation, or footprint, which is predicted to flatten in response to increased membrane tension. Here, using a hyperbolic tangent model, we show that, due to the intrinsic bending rigidity of the membrane, the overlap of neighboring Piezo1 footprints produces a flattening of the Piezo1 footprints and arms. Multiple all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of Piezo1 further reveal that this tension-independent flattening is accompanied by gating motions that open an activation gate in the pore. This open state recapitulates experimentally obtained ionic selectivity, unitary conductance, and mutant phenotypes. Tracking ion permeation along the open pore reveals the presence of intracellular and extracellular fenestrations acting as cation-selective sites. Simulations also reveal multiple potential binding sites for phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. We propose that the overlap of Piezo channel footprints may act as a cooperative mechanism to regulate channel activity.},

  abstract = {Nanorobots are safe and exhibit powerful functionalities, including delivery, therapy, and diagnosis. Therefore, they are in high demand for the development of new cancer therapies. Although many studies have contributed to the progressive development of the nanorobot system for anticancer drug delivery, these systems still face some critical limitations, such as potentially toxic materials in the nanorobots, unreasonable sizes for passive targeting, and the lack of several essential functions of the nanorobot for anticancer drug delivery including sensing, active targeting, controlling drug release, and sufficient drug loading capacity. Here, we developed a multifunctional nanorobot system capable of precise magnetic control, sufficient drug loading for chemotherapy, light-triggered controlled drug release, light absorption for photothermal therapy, enhanced magnetic resonance imaging, and tumor sensing. The developed nanorobot system exhibits an in vitro synergetic antitumor effect of photothermal therapy and chemotherapy and outstanding tumor-targeting efficiency in both in vitro and in vivo environments. The results of this study encourage further explorations of an efficient active drug delivery system for cancer treatment and the development of nanorobot systems for other biomedical applications.},

Autonomous motion is a key element of these devices. A high surface area is preferable as it leads to increased propellant or cargo-loading capability. Integrating highly ordered and porous metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with self-propelled machines is demonstrated to have a significant impact on the field of nano/micro/millimeter-sized devices for a wide range of applications. MOFs have shown great potential in many research fields due to their tailorable pore size. These fields include energy storage and conversion; catalysis, biomedical application (e.g., drug delivery, imaging, and cancer therapy), and environmental remediation. The marriage of motors and MOFs may provide opportunities for many new applications for synthetic nano/micro/millimeter-sized machines.

While single-molecule localization microscopy techniques allow the visualization and identification of cellular structures with near-molecular resolution, multiplex-labeling of tens of target proteins within the same sample has not yet been achieved routinely. However, single sample multiplexing is essential to detect patterns that threaten to get lost in multi-sample averaging. Here, we report maS               3               TORM (multiplexed automated serial staining stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy), a microscopy approach capable of fully automated 3D direct STORM (               d               STORM) imaging and solution exchange employing a re-staining protocol to achieve highly multiplexed protein localization within individual biological samples. We demonstrate 3D super-resolution images of 15 targets in single cultured cells and 16 targets in individual neuronal tissue samples with {$<$}10\,nm localization precision, allowing us to define distinct nano-architectural features of protein distribution within the presynaptic nerve terminal.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            Facile diffusion of globular proteins within a cytoplasm that is dense with biopolymers is essential to normal cellular biochemical activity and growth. Remarkably,               Escherichia coli               grows in minimal medium over a wide range of external osmolalities (0.03 to 1.8 osmol). The mean cytoplasmic biopolymer volume fraction (〈φ〉) for such adapted cells ranges from 0.16 at 0.10 osmol to 0.36 at 1.45 osmol. For cells grown at 0.28 osmol, a similar 〈φ〉 range is obtained by plasmolysis (sudden osmotic upshift) using NaCl or sucrose as the external osmolyte, after which the only available cellular response is passive loss of cytoplasmic water. Here we measure the effective axial diffusion coefficient of green fluorescent protein (               D               GFP               ) in the cytoplasm of               E. coli               cells as a function of 〈φ〉 for both plasmolyzed and adapted cells. For plasmolyzed cells, the median               D               GFP               (                                \textbackslash batchmode \textbackslash documentclass[fleqn,10pt,legalpaper]\{article\} \textbackslash usepackage\{amssymb\} \textbackslash usepackage\{amsfonts\} \textbackslash usepackage\{amsmath\} \textbackslash pagestyle\{empty\} \textbackslash begin\{document\} \textbackslash (D\_\{GFP\}\^\{m\}\textbackslash ) \textbackslash end\{document\}                              ) decreases by a factor of 70 as 〈φ〉 increases from 0.16 to 0.33. In sharp contrast, for adapted cells,                                \textbackslash batchmode \textbackslash documentclass[fleqn,10pt,legalpaper]\{article\} \textbackslash usepackage\{amssymb\} \textbackslash usepackage\{amsfonts\} \textbackslash usepackage\{amsmath\} \textbackslash pagestyle\{empty\} \textbackslash begin\{document\} \textbackslash (D\_\{GFP\}\^\{m\}\textbackslash ) \textbackslash end\{document\}                              decreases only by a factor of 2.1 as 〈φ〉 increases from 0.16 to 0.36. Clearly, GFP diffusion is not determined by 〈φ〉 alone. By comparison with quantitative models, we show that the data cannot be explained by crowding theory. We suggest possible underlying causes of this surprising effect and further experiments that will help choose among competing hypotheses. Recovery of the ability of proteins to diffuse in the cytoplasm after plasmolysis may well be a key determinant of the time scale of the recovery of growth.},

  abstract = {The building blocks of the nanostructures observed onDrosophilacorneas are determined, and then used to create artificial nanostructures with anti-reflective and anti-adhesive properties. Insect eyes have an anti-reflective coating, owing to nanostructures on the corneal surface creating a gradient of refractive index between that of air and that of the lens material(1,2). These nanocoatings have also been shown to provide anti-adhesive functionality(3). The morphology of corneal nanocoatings are very diverse in arthropods, with nipple-like structures that can be organized into arrays or fused into ridge-like structures(4). This diversity can be attributed to a reaction-diffusion mechanism(4)and patterning principles developed by Alan Turing(5), which have applications in numerous biological settings(6). The nanocoatings on insect corneas are one example of such Turing patterns, and the first known example of nanoscale Turing patterns(4). Here we demonstrate a clear link between the morphology and function of the nanocoatings onDrosophilacorneas. We find that nanocoatings that consist of individual protrusions have better anti-reflective properties, whereas partially merged structures have better anti-adhesion properties. We use biochemical analysis and genetic modification techniques to reverse engineer the protein Retinin and corneal waxes as the building blocks of the nanostructures. In the context of Turing patterns, these building blocks fulfil the roles of activator and inhibitor, respectively. We then establish low-cost production of Retinin, and mix this synthetic protein with waxes to forward engineer various artificial nanocoatings with insect-like morphology and anti-adhesive or anti-reflective function. Our combined reverse- and forward-engineering approach thus provides a way to economically produce functional nanostructured coatings from biodegradable materials.},

  abstract = {CONSPECTUS: The past decades have witnessed the development of a field dedicated to targeting tumor vasculature for cancer therapy. In contrast to conventional chemotherapeutics that need to penetrate into tumor tissues for killing tumor cells, the agents targeting tumor vascular system have two major advantages: direct contact with vascular endothelial cells or the blood and less possibility to induce drug resistance because of high gene stability of endothelial cells. More specifically, various angiogenesis inhibitors (AIs) and vascular disrupting agents (VDAs) that block tumor blood supply to inhibit tumor progression, some of which have been applied clinically, have been described. However, off-target effects and high effective doses limit the utility of these formulations in cancer patients. Thus, new strategies with improved therapeutic efficacy and safety are needed for tumor vessel targeting therapy. With the burgeoning developments in nanotechnology, smart nanotherapeutics now offer unprecedented potential for targeting tumor vasculature. Based on specific structural and functional features of the tumor vasculature, a number of different nanoscale delivery systems have been proposed for cancer therapy. In this Account, we summarize several distinct strategies to modulate tumor vasculature with various smart nanotherapeutics for safe and effective tumor therapy developed by our research programs. Inspired by the blood coagulation cascade, we generated nanoparticle-mediated tumor vessel infarction strategies that selectively block tumor blood supply to starve the tumor to death. By specifically delivering thrombin loaded DNA nanorobots (Nanorobot-Th) into tumor vessels, an intratumoral thrombosis is triggered to induce vascular infarction and, ultimately, tumor necrosis. Mimicking the coagulation cascade, a smart polymeric nanogel achieves permanent and peripheral embolization of liver tumors. Considering the critical role of platelets in maintaining tumor vessel integrity, a hybrid (PLP-D-R) nanoparticle selectively depleting tumor-associated platelets (TAP) to boost tumor vessel permeability was developed for enhancing intratumoral drug accumulation. In addition, benefiting from a better understanding of the molecular and cellular underpinnings of vascular normalization, several tumor acidity responsive nanotherapeutics, encapsulating therapeutic peptides, and small interfering RNA were developed to correct the abnormal features of the tumor vasculature. This made the tumor vessels more efficient for drug delivery. While we are still exploring the mechanisms of action of these novel nanoformulations, we expect that the strategies summarized here will offer a promising platform to design effective next-generation nanotherapeutics against cancer and facilitate the clinical translation of smart nanotherapeutics that target tumor vasculature.},

Here, we use deep learning to develop a rapid, automatic SMFM trace selector, termed AutoSiM, that improves the sensitivity and specificity of an assay for a DNA point mutation based on single-molecule recognition through equilibrium Poisson sampling (SiMREPS). The improved performance of AutoSiM is based on accepting both more true positives and fewer false positives than the conventional approach of hidden Markov modeling (HMM) followed by hard thresholding. As a second application, the selector is used for automated screening of single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) data to identify high-quality traces for further analysis, and achieves \textasciitilde 90\% concordance with manual selection while requiring less processing time. Finally, we show that AutoSiM can be adapted readily to novel datasets, requiring only modest Transfer Learning.},

Here we use cryo-electron microscopy to show that PIEZO1 adopts different degrees of curvature in lipid vesicles of different sizes. We also use high-speed atomic force microscopy to analyse the deformability of PIEZO1 under force in membranes on a mica surface, and show that PIEZO1 can be flattened reversibly into the membrane plane. By approximating the absolute force applied, we estimate a range of values for the mechanical spring constant of PIEZO1. Both methods of microscopy demonstrate that PIEZO1 can deform its shape towards a planar structure. This deformation could explain how lateral membrane tension can be converted into a conformation-dependent change in free energy to gate the PIEZO1 channel in response to mechanical perturbations.},

In our design, the branched DNA structure can efficiently load a sgRNA/Cas9/antisense complex targeting a tumor-associated gene, PLK1, through DNA self-assembly. With the incorporation of an active targeting aptamer and an endosomal escape peptide by host-guest interaction, the biocompatible DNA nanoplatform demonstrates efficient inhibition of tumor growth without apparent systemic toxicity. This multifunctional DNA nanocarrier provides a new strategy for the development of gene therapeutics.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Cell membrane coated nanoparticles (NPs) have recently been recognized as attractive nanomedical tools because of their unique properties such as immune escape, long blood circulation time, specific molecular recognition and cell targeting. However, the integrity of the cell membrane coating on NPs, a key metrics related to the quality of these biomimetic-systems and their resulting biomedical function, has remained largely unexplored. Here, we report a fluorescence quenching assay to probe the integrity of cell membrane coating. In contradiction to the common assumption of perfect coating, we uncover that up to 90\% of the biomimetic NPs are only partially coated. Using in vitro homologous targeting studies, we demonstrate that partially coated NPs could still be internalized by the target cells. By combining molecular simulations with experimental analysis, we further identify an endocytic entry mechanism for these NPs. We unravel that NPs with a high coating degree (≥50\%) enter the cells individually, whereas the NPs with a low coating degree ({$<$}50\%) need to aggregate together before internalization. This quantitative method and the fundamental understanding of how cell membrane coated NPs enter the cells will enhance the rational designing of biomimetic nanosystems and pave the way for more effective cancer nanomedicine.},

A major challenge in cancer vaccine therapy is the efficient delivery of antigens and adjuvants to stimulate a controlled yet robust tumour-specific T-cell response. Here, we describe a structurally well defined DNA nanodevice vaccine generated by precisely assembling two types of molecular adjuvants and an antigen peptide within the inner cavity of a tubular DNA nanostructure that can be activated in the subcellular environment to trigger T-cell activation and cancer cytotoxicity. The integration of low pH-responsive DNA 'locking strands' outside the nanostructures enables the opening of the vaccine in lysosomes in antigen-presenting cells, exposing adjuvants and antigens to activate a strong immune response. The DNA nanodevice vaccine elicited a potent antigen-specific T-cell response, with subsequent tumour regression in mouse cancer models. Nanodevice vaccination generated long-term T-cell responses that potently protected the mice against tumour rechallenge.},

DNA nanostructures have been considered one of the most promising nanocarriers. In the present study, we report a DNA framework-based intelligent DNA nanorobot for selective lysosomal degradation of tumor-specific proteins on cancer cells. We site-specifically anchored an anti-HER2 aptamer (HApt) on a tetrahedral framework nucleic acid (tFNA). This DNA nanorobot (HApt-tFNA) could target HER2-positive breast cancer cells and specifically induce the lysosomal degradation of the membrane protein HER2. An injection of the DNA nanorobot into a mouse model revealed that the presence of tFNA enhanced the stability and prolonged the blood circulation time of HApt, and HApt-tFNA could therefore drive HER2 into lysosomal degradation with a higher efficiency. The formation of the HER2-HApt-tFNA complexes resulted in the HER2-mediated endocytosis and digestion in lysosomes, which effectively reduced the amount of HER2 on the cell surfaces. An increased HER2 digestion through HApt-tFNA further induced cell apoptosis and arrested cell growth. Hence, this novel DNA nanorobot sheds new light on targeted protein degradation for precision breast cancer therapy.},

The spectra are simulated in all their components, namely the energy position and the lineshapes of both the far-red and the blue bands. To achieve such a goal, we have combined a 4.5 μs MD simulation of the solvated dimeric phytochrome with a hybrid quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) model, which accounts for both electrostatic and mutual polarization effects between the QM and the MM subsystems. A good agreement with experiments is found for all the three spectra. Moreover, we find a transient H-bond network within the binding pocket of the biliverdin chromophore that, unexpectedly, does not significantly affect the spectra. In parallel, we characterize the vibrations that are more strongly coupled to the biliverdin excitation, confirming the important role of the hydrogen-out-of-plane mode of its vinyl C–H together with the expected CC stretching of the double bond involved in the photoisomerization.},

  abstract = {We report a DNA nanotechnology-enabled approach for the rational design of an allosteric deoxyribozyme by precisely and dynamically controlling the nanometer-scale interactions of two catalytic centers within a well-defined tetrahedral DNA scaffold.           ,              Recognition of the fundamental importance of allosteric regulation in biology dates back to not long after its discovery in the 1960s. Our ability to rationally engineer this potentially useful property into normally non-allosteric catalysts, however, remains limited. In response we report a DNA nanotechnology-enabled approach for introducing allostery into catalytic nucleic acids. Specifically, we have grafted one or two copies of a peroxidase-like DNAzyme, hemin-bound G-quadruplex (hemin-G), onto a DNA tetrahedral nanostructure in such a manner as to cause them to interact, modulating their catalytic activity. We achieve allosteric regulation of these catalysts by incorporating dynamically responsive oligonucleotides that respond to specific “effector” molecules (complementary oligonucleotides or small molecules), altering the spacing between the catalytic sites and thus regulating their activity. This designable approach thus enables subtle allosteric modulation in DNAzymes that is potentially of use for nanomedicine and nanomachines.},

Fluorescence correlation and cross-correlation spectroscopy (FCS and FCCS) are appealing technologies to study these macromolecular structures because they have single molecule sensitivity and readily provide information about their molecular composition and dynamics. Here, we demonstrate how FCS can be exploited to study cytoplasmic mRNPs with high accuracy and reproducibility in cell lysates. Cellular lysates not only recapitulate data from live cells but provide improved readings and allow investigation of single mRNP analysis under particular conditions or following enzymatic treatments. Moreover, FCCS employing minute amounts of cells closely corroborated previously reported RNA dependent interactions and provided estimates of the relative overlap between factors in the mRNPs, thus depicting their heterogeneity. The described lysate-based FCS and FCCS analysis may not only complement current biochemical approaches but also provide novel opportunities for the quantitative analysis of the molecular composition and dynamics of single mRNPs.},

By using DNA as a biologically "safe" material, DNA nanotechnology shows great promise in applications such as drug-delivery systems.

Moreover, this knowledge must then be harnessed in innovative ways to improve existing DNA nanostructures and design new ones, so that they can perform more diverse functions more effectively. There have been many developments in this regard in the past few years, and herein some of these are highlighted, with respect to both works that improve our understanding of what happens to DNA nanostructures once they are at their target site, and those that utilise clever design to accomplish desired functions.},

Over the past decade, sophisticated single-component nanostructures composed exclusively of nucleic acids(2-5), peptides(6-8) and proteins(9-15) have been reported, and these nanostructures have been used in a wide range of applications, from drug delivery(16) to molecular computing(17). Despite these successes, the development of hybrid co-assemblies of nucleic acids and proteins has remained elusive. Here we use computational protein design to create a protein-DNA co-assembling nanomaterial whose assembly is driven via non-covalent interactions. To achieve this, a homodimerization interface is engineered onto the Drosophila Engrailed homeodomain (ENH), allowing the dimerized protein complex to bind to two double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) molecules. By varying the arrangement of protein-binding sites on the dsDNA, an irregular bulk nanoparticle or a nanowire with single-molecule width can be spontaneously formed by mixing the protein and dsDNA building blocks. We characterize the protein-DNA nanowire using fluorescence microscopy, atomic force microscopy and X-ray crystallography, confirming that the nanowire is formed via the proposed mechanism. This work lays the foundation for the development of new classes of protein-DNA hybrid materials. Further applications can be explored by incorporating DNA origami, DNA aptamers and/or peptide epitopes into the protein-DNA framework presented here.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Single-stranded telomeric overhangs are ∼200 nucleotides long and can form tandem G-quadruplex (GQ) structures, which reduce their accessibility to nucleases and proteins that activate DNA damage response. Whether these tandem GQs further stack to form compact superstructures, which may provide better protection for longer telomeres, is not known. We report single-molecule measurements where the accessibility of 24–144 nucleotide long human telomeric DNA molecules is interrogated by a short PNA molecule that is complementary to a single GGGTTA repeat, as implemented in the FRET-PAINT method. Binding of the PNA strand to available GGGTTA sequences results in discrete FRET bursts which were analyzed in terms of their dwell times, binding frequencies, and topographic distributions. The binding frequencies were greater for binding to intermediate regions of telomeric DNA compared to 3′- or 5′-ends, suggesting these regions are more accessible. Significantly, the binding frequency per telomeric repeat monotonically decreased with increasing telomere length. These results are consistent with telomeres forming more compact structures at longer lengths, reducing accessibility of these critical genomic sites.},

In LIVE-PAINT only a short peptide sequence is fused to the protein being studied, unlike conventional super-resolution methods, which rely on directly fusing the biomolecule of interest to a large fluorescent protein, organic fluorophore, or oligonucleotide. LIVE-PAINT works by observing the blinking of localized fluorescence as this peptide is reversibly bound by a protein that is fused to a fluorescent protein. We have demonstrated the effectiveness of LIVE-PAINT by imaging a number of different proteins inside live               S. cerevisiae               . Not only is LIVE-PAINT widely applicable, easily implemented, and the modifications minimally perturbing, but we also anticipate it will extend data acquisition times compared to those previously possible with methods that involve direct fusion to a fluorescent protein.},

A significant advance has been made in the construction of diverse motors over the last decade. These synthetic motor systems, with rapid transporting and efficient cargo towing abilities, are expected to open up new horizons for various applications. Utilizing emergent motor platforms for in vivo applications is one important aspect receiving growing interest as conventional therapeutic methodology still remains limited for cancer, heart, or vasculature diseases. In this review we will highlight the recent efforts towards realistic in vivo application of various motor systems. With ever booming research enthusiasm in this field and increasing multidisciplinary cooperation, micro/ nanomotors with integrated multifunctionality and selectivity are on their way to revolutionize clinical practice.},

However, in practice it is not always easy to ascertain whether the carbonyl or nitrile group in question is engaged in such interactions. Herein, we use 4-cyanoindole and cyclopentanone as models to show that, when a fundamental CO or CN stretching mode is involved in Fermi resonance, the underlying vibrational coupling constant (               W               ) is a convenient reporter of the hydrogen-bonding status of the corresponding carbonyl or nitrile group. Specifically, we find that for both groups a               W               value of 7.7 cm               −1               or greater is indicative of their involvement in hydrogen-bonding interactions. Furthermore, we find that, as observed in similar studies, the Fermi resonance coupling leads to quantum beats in the two-dimensional infrared spectra of 4-cyanoindole in isopropanol, with a period of about 1.9 ps.},

  abstract = {Osmotic pressure (Π) induces membrane tension in cell membranes and the lipid bilayers of vesicles and plays an important role in the functions and physical properties of these membranes. We recently developed a method to determine quantitatively the membrane tension of giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) under Π and applied it to GUVs comprising electrically neutral dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC). Here, we examined the effect of Π on GUVs composed of DOPC and negatively charged dioleoylphosphatidylglycerol (DOPG) in a buffer containing a physiological concentration of ions. First, we examined the rate constant, kr, for constant tension (σex)-induced rupture of DOPG/DOPC (4/6)-GUVs under Π and obtained the dependence of kr on σex in GUVs for various values of Π. Comparing this dependence in the absence of Π provided values for membrane tension due to Π, σosm, which agree with the theoretical values within the experimental error. The values of σosm for DOPG/DOPC-GUVs were smaller than those for DOPC-GUVs under the same Π. Two factors, that is, the solute concentration in a GUV suspension and the elastic modulus of the GUV membrane, can reasonably explain this difference based on the theory of σosm. We also examined the effect of Π on the rate constant, kFF, for the transbilayer movement of lipid molecules in single GUVs. The values of kFF increased with increasing Π, indicating that kFF increased with σosm. This result supports the existence of prepores in stretched lipid bilayers. Based on these results, we discuss the membrane tension of DOPG/DOPC-GUVs under Π.},

Although there have been many studies on the application of functional particles to cells, the basic mechanism of penetration across a biological membrane is still poorly understood. Here we used a model membrane system to demonstrate that lateral membrane tension drives particle penetration across a lipid bilayer. After the application of osmotic pressure, fully wrapped particles on a liposome surface were found to enter the liposome. We discuss the mechanism of the tension-induced penetration in terms of narrow constriction of the membrane at the neck part. The present findings are expected to provide insight into the application of particles to biological systems.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short (19–24 nt) non-coding RNAs that suppress the expression of protein coding genes at the post-transcriptional level. Differential expression profiles of miRNAs across a range of diseases have emerged as powerful biomarkers, making a reliable yet rapid profiling technique for miRNAs potentially essential in clinics. Here, we report an amplification-free multi-color single-molecule imaging technique that can profile purified endogenous miRNAs with high sensitivity, specificity, and reliability. Compared to previously reported techniques, our technique can discriminate single base mismatches and single-nucleotide 3′-tailing with low false positive rates regardless of their positions on miRNA. By preloading probes in               Thermus thermophilus               Argonaute (               Tt               Ago), miRNAs detection speed is accelerated by more than 20 times. Finally, by utilizing the well-conserved linearity between single-molecule spot numbers and the target miRNA concentrations, the absolute average copy numbers of endogenous miRNA species in a single cell can be estimated. Thus our technique, Ago-FISH (Argonaute-based Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization), provides a reliable way to accurately profile various endogenous miRNAs on a single miRNA sensing chip.},

  abstract = {DNA point accumulation for imaging in nanoscale topography (PAINT) is a rapidly developing fluorescence super-resolution technique, which allows for reaching spatial resolutions below 10 nm. It also enables the imaging of multiple targets in the same sample. However, using DNA-PAINT to observe cellular structures at such resolution remains challenging. Antibodies, which are commonly used for this purpose, lead to a displacement between the target protein and the reporting fluorophore of 20–25 nm, thus limiting the resolving power. Here, we used nanobodies to minimize this linkage error to \textasciitilde 4 nm. We demonstrate multiplexed imaging by using three nanobodies, each able to bind to a different family of fluorescent proteins. We couple the nanobodies with single DNA strands via a straight forward and stoichiometric chemical conjugation. Additionally, we built a versatile computer-controlled microfluidic setup to enable multiplexed DNA-PAINT in an efficient manner. As a proof of principle, we labeled and imaged proteins on mitochondria, the Golgi apparatus, and chromatin. We obtained super-resolved images of the three targets with 20 nm resolution, and within only 35 minutes acquisition time.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Protein-protein interactions are spatially regulated in living cells to realize high reaction efficiency, as seen in naturally existing electron-transfer chains. Nevertheless, arrangement of chemical/biochemical components at the artificial device interfaces does not possess the same level of control. Here we report a tetrahedral DNA framework-enabled bulk enzyme heterojunction (BEH) strategy to program the multi-enzyme catalytic cascade at the interface of electrochemical biosensors. The construction of interpenetrating network of BEH at the millimeter-scale electrode interface brings enzyme pairs within the critical coupling length (CCL) of \textasciitilde 10\,nm, which in turn greatly improve the overall catalytic cascade efficiency by \textasciitilde 10-fold. We demonstrate the BEH generality with a range of enzyme pairs for electrochemically detecting clinically relevant molecular targets. As a proof~of~concept, a BEH-based sarcosine sensor enables single-step detection of the metabolic biomarker of sarcosine with ultrasensitivity, which hold the potential for precision diagnosis of early-stage prostate cancer.},

  abstract = {DNA nanotechnology has provided new strategies and platforms for cargo delivery. However, DNA-based nanostructures utilized for cargo delivery have mainly focused on static structures and passive targeting. Here, inspired by honeybee's natural reaction to hazards, a melittin loaded tetrahedron framework nucleic acid (tFNA) nanostructure, for active targeting therapy as a "nanobee" is developed. Upon exposure to target proteins on the cell membrane, the tFNA exoskeleton goes through conformation change, leading to the selective release of melittin from the exoskeleton and the consequent selective lethal effect. As a result, the active targeting of the nanobee to tumor cells is achieved. At the same concentrations of melittin, the nanobee exhibits significantly higher and more selective cytotoxicity against target cells than free melittin molecules, whereas the inactive nanobee shows neglectable lethal effect. Notably, the complete encapsulation of melittin in the tFNA exoskeleton is confirmed by the combination of experimental screening and molecular dynamic analysis, which is proposed to be the origin of the minimized off-target effects of nanobee. This nanobee concept offers a strategy that may be extended to various dynamic stimuli-responsive cargo delivery systems, to enhance cargo stability and decrease severe off-target effects.},

  abstract = {Single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) is a potent tool to examine biological systems with unprecedented resolution, enabling the investigation of increasingly smaller structures. At the forefront of these developments is DNA-based point accumulation for~imaging in nanoscale topography (DNA-PAINT), which exploits the stochastic and transient binding of fluorescently labeled DNA probes. In its early stages the implementation of DNA-PAINT was burdened by low-throughput, excessive acquisition time, and difficult integration with live-cell imaging. However, recent advances are addressing these challenges and expanding the range of applications of DNA-PAINT. We review the current state of the art of DNA-PAINT in light of these advances and contemplate what further developments remain indispensable to realize live-cell imaging.},

  abstract = {We develop a detailed description of protein translational and rotational diffusion in concentrated solution on the basis of all-atom molecular dynamics simulations in explicit solvent. Our systems contain up to 540 fully flexible proteins with 3.6 million atoms. In concentrated protein solutions (100 mg/mL and higher), the proteins ubiquitin and lysozyme, as well as the protein domains third IgG-binding domain of protein G and villin headpiece, diffuse not as isolated particles, but as members of transient clusters between which they constantly exchange. A dynamic cluster model nearly quantitatively explains the increase in viscosity and the decrease in protein diffusivity with protein volume fraction, which both exceed the predictions from widely used colloid models. The Stokes–Einstein relations for translational and rotational diffusion remain valid, but the effective hydrodynamic radius grows linearly with protein volume fraction. This increase follows the observed increase in cluster size and explains the more dramatic slowdown of protein rotation compared with translation. Baxter’s sticky-sphere model of colloidal suspensions captures the concentration dependence of cluster size, viscosity, and rotational and translational diffusion. The consistency between simulations and experiments for a diverse set of soluble globular proteins indicates that the cluster model applies broadly to concentrated protein solutions, with equilibrium dissociation constants for nonspecific protein–protein binding in the K               d               ≈ 10-mM regime.},

Despite the enthusiasm and innovations fuelled by DL technology, the need to access powerful and compatible resources to train DL networks leads to an accessibility barrier that novice users often find difficult to overcome. Here, we present ZeroCostDL4Mic, an entry-level platform simplifying DL access by leveraging the free, cloud-based computational resources of Google Colab. ZeroCostDL4Mic allows researchers with no coding expertise to train and apply key DL networks to perform tasks including segmentation (using U-Net and StarDist), object detection (using YOLOv2), denoising (using CARE and Noise2Void), super-resolution microscopy (using Deep-STORM), and image-to-image translation (using Label-free prediction - fnet, pix2pix and CycleGAN). Importantly, we provide suitable quantitative tools for each network to evaluate model performance, allowing model optimisation. We demonstrate the application of the platform to study multiple biological processes.},

Conventional DNA catabolic strategies are restrained with the fragile and unclear enzymatic reactions that might lead to inefficient and uncontrollable digestion of DNA scaffolds and thus might bring undesirable side effects to the sophisticated biosystems. Herein we reported a versatile self-sufficient DNAzyme-driven drug delivery system consisting of the rolling circle polymerized DNAzyme-substrate scaffolds and the encapsulated pH-responsive ZnO nanoparticles (NPs). The full DNAzyme nanosponges (NSs) were also encoded with multivalent tandem aptamer sequences to facilitate their efficient delivery into cancer cells, where the acidic endo/lysosomal microenvironment stimulates the dissolution of ZnO into Zn2+ ions as DNAzyme cofactors and therapeutic reactive oxygen species generators. The supplement Zn2+ cofactors mediated the nonviolent DNAzyme-catalyzed cleavage of DNA scaffolds for precise and efficient drug administrations with synergistically enhanced therapeutic performance. The facile design of DNAzyme, together with their cost-effective and intrinsic robust features, is anticipated to provide extensive insights for the development of DNA-based therapeutic platforms by activating the specific intracellular biocatalytic reactions. As an intelligent and nonviolent self-driven drug delivery platform, the present DNAzyme NS system could be engineered with more therapeutic sequences and agents and was anticipated to show exceptional promise and versatility for applications in biomedicine and bioengineering.},

The last two decades have witnessed a surge of research interests in the biomedical applications of nanomotors, but little clinical translation. To accelerate this process, targeted cancer therapy is used as an example to describe a "survive, locate, operate, and terminate" (SLOT) mission of a nanomotor, where it must 1) survive in the unfriendly in vivo environment, 2) locate its target as well as be located by human operators, 3) carry out specific operations, and 4) terminate after the mission is completed. Along this journey, the challenges presented to a nanomotor, including to power, navigate, steer, target, release, control, image, and communicate are discussed, and how state-of-the-art nanomotors meet or fall short of these requirements is critically reviewed. These discussions are then condensed into a table for easy reference. In particular, it is argued that chemically powered nanomotors are intrinsically ill-positioned for targeted cancer therapy, while nanomotors powered by magnetic fields or ultrasound show more promises. Following this argument, a tentative nanomotor design is then presented in the end to conform to the SLOT guideline, and to inspire practical, functional nanorobots that are yet to come.},

  abstract = {In recent years, DNA has been widely noted as a kind of material that can be used to construct building blocks for biosensing, in vivo imaging, drug development, and disease therapy because of its advantages of good biocompatibility and programmable properties. However, traditional DNA-based sensing processes are mostly achieved by random diffusion of free DNA probes, which were restricted by limited dynamics and relatively low efficiency. Moreover, in the application of biosystems, single-stranded DNA probes face challenges such as being difficult to internalize into cells and being easily decomposed in the cellular microenvironment. To overcome the above limitations, DNA nanostructure-based probes have attracted intense attention. This kind of probe showed a series of advantages compared to the conventional ones, including increased biostability, enhanced cell internalization efficiency, accelerated reaction rate, and amplified signal output, and thus improved in vitro and in vivo applications. Therefore, reviewing and summarizing the important roles of DNA nanostructures in improving biosensor design is very necessary for the development of DNA nanotechnology and its applications in biology and pharmacology. In this perspective, DNA nanostructure-based probes are reviewed and summarized from several aspects: probe classification according to the dimensions of DNA nanostructures (one, two, and three-dimensional nanostructures), the common connection modes between nucleic acid probes and DNA nanostructures, and the most important advantages of DNA self-assembled nanostructures in the applications of biosensing, imaging analysis, cell assembly, cell capture, and theranostics. Finally, the challenges and prospects for the future development of DNA nanostructure-based nucleic acid probes are also discussed.},

  abstract = {Abstract             DNA origami, in which a long scaffold strand is assembled with a many short staple strands into parallel arrays of double helices, has proven a powerful method for custom nanofabrication. However, currently the design and optimization of custom 3D DNA-origami shapes is a barrier to rapid application to new areas. Here we introduce a modular barrel architecture, and demonstrate hierarchical assembly of a 100 megadalton DNA-origami barrel of \textasciitilde 90\,nm diameter and \textasciitilde 250\,nm height, that provides a rhombic-lattice canvas of a thousand pixels each, with pitch of \textasciitilde 8\,nm, on its inner and outer surfaces. Complex patterns rendered on these surfaces were resolved using up to twelve rounds of Exchange-PAINT super-resolution microscopy. We envision these structures as versatile nanoscale pegboards for applications requiring complex 3D arrangements of matter, which will serve to promote rapid uptake of this technology in diverse fields beyond specialist groups working in DNA nanotechnology.},

  abstract = {We present a statistical framework to model the spatial distribution of molecules based on a single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) dataset. The latter consists of a collection of spatial coordinates and their associated uncertainties. We describe iterative parameter-estimation algorithms based on this framework, as well as a sampling algorithm to numerically evaluate the complete posterior distribution. We demonstrate that the inverse computation can be viewed as a type of image restoration process similar to the classical image deconvolution methods, except that it is performed on SMLM images. We further discuss an application of our statistical framework in the task of particle fusion using SMLM data. We show that the fusion algorithm based on our model outperforms the current state-of-the-art in terms of both accuracy and computational cost.},

However, constructing protocols based on biomolecular reactions to guarantee confidentiality, integrity and availability (CIA) of information remains a challenge. Here we develop DNA origami cryptography (DOC) that exploits folding of a M13 viral scaffold into nanometer-scale self-assembled braille-like patterns for secure communication, which can create a key with a size of over 700 bits. The intrinsic nanoscale addressability of DNA origami additionally allows for protein binding-based steganography, which further protects message confidentiality in DOC. The integrity of a transmitted message can be ensured by establishing specific linkages between several DNA origamis carrying parts of the message. The versatility of DOC is further demonstrated by transmitting various data formats including text, musical notes and images, supporting its great potential for meeting the rapidly increasing CIA demands of next-generation cryptography.},
